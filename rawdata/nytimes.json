But before the new legislature could take charge, the Socialists approved 13 new Supreme Court justices, and days later, the court blocked four opposition lawmakers from taking their seats. That decision has created uncertainty about the supermajority, which the president’s rivals need to gain added powers, including the ability to remove Supreme Court justices and change the Constitution. On Wednesday, three of the four politicians were sworn in over objections of the Socialists. “What’s happening today is a flagrant violation of the Venezuelan Constitution,” said Diosdado Cabello, a Socialist lawmaker and the former leader of the Assembly. He said that the Socialists would ask the Supreme Court to find the Assembly leadership in contempt of the court order that blocked the politicians from taking their seats. </p></div>"}

Por fin habían sido capaces de dar un golpe contundente al gobierno, y planeaban anunciar que no solo habían ganado por mayoría sino que habían logrado una arrolladora victoria al hacerse con dos terceras partes de los curules de la Asamblea Nacional.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Pero mientras los reporteros esperaban a que comenzara el evento, una curiosa imagen apareció en el televisor de la pared: uno de los miembros más destacados de la oposición, el dos veces candidato presidencial Henrique Capriles, estaba ofreciendo otra conferencia de prensa al otro lado de la ciudad.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Fue una señal muy reveladora de los retos que le esperan a la oposición de Venezuela, que por muchos años ha luchado para superar sus fracturas internas. Si bien la frágil coalición logró unirse para alcanzar la victoria sobre el gobierno chavista este domingo 6 de diciembre, ahora se enfrenta a otra prueba: cómo mantenerse unida para poder aprovechar su nueva autoridad legislativa y abordar los profundos problemas económicos y las divisiones políticas del país.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La Unidad Democrática, como se conoce al conglomerado de partidos dispares de oposición, anunció que sus candidatos habían ganado por lo menos 112 asientos de los 167 que forman la Asamblea Nacional, que tomará juramento el 5 de enero. Esto le daría la mayoría de dos tercios necesaria para convocar una convención constituyente, destituir magistrados del Tribunal Supremo de Justicia, por ejemplo, e implementar otras medidas para ejercer mayor presión sobre el gobierno socialista del Presidente Nicolás Maduro.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Las autoridades precisaron que el Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela de Maduro había obtenido 51 curules y que aun faltaba determinar los ganadores en cuatro jurisdicciones.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Incluso con una mayoría más pequeña, los legisladores de oposición podrían destituir al vicepresidente, a miembros del gabinete y a los directores del banco central, y también abrir investigaciones sobre corrupción.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Enrique Márquez, legislador de oposición que resultó reelegido, acusó al gobierno de retener de manera deliberada los resultados de algunas elecciones para ocultar la extensión de su derrota.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">El chavismo, el movimiento iniciado por el carismático predecesor de Maduro, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/world/americas/hugo-chavez-venezuelas-polarizing-leader-dies-at-58.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">Hugo Chávez</a>, fue arrasado en algunos de sus bastiones más tradicionales. Por ejemplo, la oposición aseguró haber ganado los dos distritos parlamentarios de Barinas, el estado natal de Chávez, donde uno de los candidatos del gobierno era el hermano del difunto presidente, Argenis Chávez.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“La victoria fue arrolladora”, afirmó Márquez.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Candidatos antichavistas también ganaron en todos los distritos de Caracas, incluso los que alguna vez fueron bastiones del gobierno. Maduro despachó a muchos de los funcionarios más reconocidos del gobierno para postularse a cargos en todo el país y, en muchos casos, perdieron.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Y según funcionarios de la oposición, en algunos estados, la oposición obtuvo más del doble de votos que el partido del gobierno.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La elección estuvo marcada por una fatiga generalizada con el gobierno de Maduro y la creciente crisis económica reflejada en una inflación de tres dígitos, escasez de productos básicos y largas filas en tiendas con anaqueles vacíos, males que miles de venezolanos tratan de sobrevivir día a día.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Aunque en la oposición hay muchos líderes y partidos, generalmente todos coinciden en principios económicos básicos, como el fomento de la empresa privada y de la inversión extranjera.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“En comparación con el chavismo y con Maduro, los dirigentes de la oposición tiene opiniones muy similares para manejar al país y, en ese sentido, no creo que sean muy grandes las diferencias entre ellos”, asegura Francisco Rodríguez, economista de Bank of America Merrill Lynch, que en abril predijo que la oposición podría ganar una mayoría de dos tercios. “Pero pienso que no hay liderazgo consolidado y, por tanto, esas diferencias van a surgir y seguirán siendo notables. Además, cuando hay una victoria como ésta, los líderes políticos tratan de sacarle partido, atribuyéndose el crédito y eso es normal.”</p></div>"}

Without them, the cantilevered sections would have to be so massive as to make the bridge too costly or otherwise impractical. And more than anything else, the stays are what made the Morandi bridge unusual: They are constructed of concrete with steel rods, called tendons, inside them, which enables the concrete to handle the pull of the roadway. More modern cable-stayed bridges use steel cables instead.</p></div>"}

Rashbaum</em></strong></p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Para muchos venezolanos, Cilia Flores, la esposa del presidente Nicolás Maduro, representa valores familiares muy particulares.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Como líder de la Asamblea Nacional en el gobierno de Hugo Chávez, fue acusada de colocar a 40 de sus familiares en cargos en la legislatura, un escándalo de nepotismo que llevó incluso a algunos de los más fervientes seguidores de la revolución socialista de Chávez a denunciarla.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Y ahora que Flores ejerce más influencia que nunca como primera dama, otros familiares están causándoles dolores de cabeza a ella y a su esposo.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Dos sobrinos de Flores <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/12/world/americas/two-from-venezuelan-presidents-family-to-face-drug-charges-in-new-york.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">fueron arrestados esta semana en Haití</a> y llevados a Estados Unidos para enfrentar cargos federales de narcotráfico.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Los dos hombres fueron identificados el jueves en un acta de encausamiento en el Tribunal Federal de Distrito en Manhattan como Efraín Antonio Campo Flores, de 29 años, y Franqui Francisco Flores de Freitas, de 30. Dos personas con conocimiento del caso dijeron que los hombres eran sobrinos de Flores.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Un funcionario del gobierno en Caracas dijo que Campo Flores era hijo de una de las hermanas de Flores, mientras que Flores de Freitas era hijo de uno de los hermanos de la primera dama. El gobierno venezolano no confirmó las relaciones.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Las autoridades estadounidenses no han sugerido que Flores o Maduro tuvieran conocimiento o estuvieran involucrados en la supuesta trama de tráfico de drogas. Pero la conexión familiar podría causarle problemas a Maduro, en especial cuando se acercan las cruciales elecciones legislativas programadas para el 6 de diciembre, pues sirve como un poderoso recordatorio de las amplias inquietudes sobre corrupción, lazos con narcotraficantes y priviliegios a familiares en los niveles superiores del gobierno.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Las acusaciones contra los sobrinos de Flores son simplemente las más recientes en una serie de investigaciones de narcotráfico que involucran a personas cercanas a Maduro y Chávez.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">El año pasado, un ex director del aparato de inteligencia del gobierno, designado por Maduro como cónsul en Aruba, fue imputado por fiscales en Estados Unidos por estar en la nómina de traficantes colombianos.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Y a principios de este año, funcionarios estadounidenses dijeron que estaban investigando posibles cargos de narcotráfico contra Diosdado Cabello, el poderoso líder de la Asamblea Nacional. Cabello negó tener algún vínculo con los traficantes, y en ambos casos Maduro defendió vigorosamente a los hombres y acusó a Estados Unidos de querer debilitar su gobierno.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">El nepotismo es otro tema candente. Chávez, quien fue presidente durante 14 años hasta que murió en 2013, colocó a un hermano a la cabeza de la compañía nacional de electricidad y a un primo en un puesto superior en la compañía petrolera operada por el gobierno. Otro hermano fue ministro de educación antes de ser elegido gobernador de su estado natal.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Pero una de las acusaciones de favoritismo más destacadas en los últimos años tuvo lugar cuando Flores fue presidenta de la Asamblea Nacional, de 2006 a 2011.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">En 2008, el líder de un sindicato progubernamental que representa a empleados de la legislatura acusó a Flores de evadir los procedimientos normales para colocar a 40 familiares en puestos de gobierno, en ocasiones pasando por encima a aplicantes más calificados.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Divulgó una lista de los familiares en puestos gubernamentales que incluía a una hermana, al menos dos hermanos, una nuera, y muchos otros.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Flores negó firmemente cualquier trato especial a sus familiares, y dijo que habían recibido sus puestos con base en sus méritos.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">En ese momento, un comentarista dijo en broma que había tantos de sus familiares trabajando en la Asamblea Nacional que si alguien decía el nombre Flores, todos volteaban.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Registros gubernamentales en línea indican que varios de los familiares de la primera dama mencionados durante el escándalo continúan teniendo cargos gubernamentales.</p></div>"}

Agregó que 20 por ciento de las importaciones declaradas por compañías privadas han sido falsas, mientras que 40 por ciento de las importaciones realizadas por agencias gubernamentales y empresas del gobierno habían sido fraudulentas.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Las trampas han sido tan abundantes que los exportadores en una zona de libre comercio en Panamá facturaron $1.400 millones de dólares en envíos a Venezuela. Sin embargo, funcionarios panameños aseguran que de esa cantidad $937 millones fueron un fraude: compañías que facturaban productos inexistentes.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">En el corazón del fraude de importaciones está el control de divisas del país, impuesto en 2003 por Chávez. Los controles se basan en parte en la noción populista de que ofrecer a los importadores dólares baratos, esencialmente subsidiados por el gobierno, se traduce en bienes importados baratos para las masas.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Pero los economistas advierten que los controles generan enormes incentivos para el fraude.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Hay muchos multimillonarios venezolanos gracias a este sistema”, aseguró un importador de ropa, alimentos, medicamentos y otros productos, que habló a condición de quedar en el anonimato. Agregó que normalmente él solo recibía 10 por ciento de lo que alegaba estar importando.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Venezuela depende enormemente de las importaciones en materia de alimentos y otros productos básicos, así como de materias primas para fabricar muchos artículos. Pero los exportadores en el extranjero no quieren hacer negocios en bolívares, la divisa venezolana. Quieren dólares u otra divisa extranjera, como euros.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Así pues, en Venezuela, los importadores obtienen la autorización del gobierno para importar un producto y después hacen la solicitud ante la agencia de control de divisas para adquirir los dólares necesarios para pagar el envío del exterior.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">El sistema rebosa de oportunidades para los abusos, siendo el principal las facturas enormemente infladas.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">En el caso de las máquinas para cortar cesped, dos compañías importaron 88 por una factura total de más de un millón de dólares, según documentos del gobierno. Las compañías afirmaron que cada máquina costaba hasta $12.300, aunque los investigadores encontraron que artículos semejantes se vendían por tan solo unos cuantos cientos de dólares.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">En otro de los casos documentados, una compañía que importaba equipo agrícola declaró el costo de una máquina para desgranar mazorcas en $477.750, cuando su verdadero precio es de unos $2900 dólares.</p></div>"}

Mr. Maduro did not name the company, which he said had 35 medium-size stores in seven states, but it was clear that he was referring to the Día a Día chain. The stores are generally located in lower-middle-class or poor neighborhoods. Promising to use an “iron fist” in tackling economic problems, Mr. Maduro said the chain, which had a warehouse full of cooking oil and other items, was “making war on the people” and would be taken over by a government supermarket network known as Pdval. Venezuela has been hit hard by the drop in the price of oil, its only major export, and shortages and long lines at stores are common. Also on Friday, the government filed criminal charges against a manager of the supermarket chain, accusing him of destabilizing the economy. It filed similar charges this week against two executives of the country’s largest pharmacy chain, Farmatodo. </p></div>"}

La situación se había puesto tan mal, dijo, que había empezado a hacer trueque con los vecinos para poner comida sobre la mesa.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Siempre supimos que este año empezaría mal, pero creo que esto es súper malo”, destacó Noriega.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Los venezolanos han soportado escasez y larga filas durante años. Pero, a medida que ha caído el precio del petróleo, la principal exportación del país, la situación se ha vuelto tan funesta que el gobierno ha enviado efectivos militares a patrullar enormes filas que serpentean a lo largo de cuadras enteras. Algunos estados han impedido que la gente espere afuera de las tiendas por la noche, en tanto funcionarios gubernamentales están apostados cerca de entradas, listos para arrestar a compradores que engañen al sistema de racionamiento.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Debido a que Venezuela depende mucho de las ventas del petróleo para comprar importaciones alimentarias, medicina y muchos otros productos básicos, la caída en los precios del petróleo significa que hay incluso menos divisa dura para comprar lo que el país necesita.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Incluso antes de que los precios del crudo se desplomaran, Venezuela estaba en los estertores de una profunda recesión, con una de las tasas inflacionarias más altas del mundo y escasez crónica de artículos básicos.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Uno de los hospitales públicos más prestigiosos de la nación cerró su unidad de cirugía del corazón durante semanas, debido a la escasez de instrumental médico. Algunos fármacos no han sido reabastecidos durante meses; los pañales son tan codiciados que algunos compradores llevan las actas de nacimiento de sus hijos por si se las exigen en las tiendas; además, cuando menos una clínica practicaba operaciones de corazón solo metiendo de contrabando un fármaco vital que traía de Estados Unidos.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Ahora, los economistas pronostican que las carencias se volverán incluso más agudas y la inflación, de por sí en 64 por ciento, subirá más. El precio del petróleo venezolano cayó este mes a 38 dólares por barril, respecto de $96 en septiembre.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Las cosas van a ser incluso peores porque el petróleo mantiene a Venezuela en marcha”, dijo Luis Castro, enfermero de 42 años de edad, parado en una fila con cientos de personas más en una tienda de abarrotes. Había llegado con su esposa e hijo de seis años de edad a las 6 de la mañana, pero, para las 11:30 a.m., aún no entraban. “Nos estamos acostumbrando a formarnos”, dijo, “y cuando te acostumbras a algo, te dan solo migajas”.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La escasez de productos e inflación presentan otra ronda de desafíos políticos para el Presidente Nicolás Maduro, quien ha jurado continuar con la revolución de inspiración socialista que empezó su predecesor, el carismático Hugo Chávez.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Yo siempre he sido chavista”, dijo Noriega. Pero, “el otro día, encontré una camiseta de Chávez que tenía guardada, y la arrojé al piso y le di de pisotones, y después la usé para limpiar el suelo. Estaba furioso. No sé si esto es o no su culpa, pero él murió y nos dejó aquí, y las cosas han ido de mal en peor”.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Venezuela tiene las mayores reservas estimadas de petróleo en el mundo y, cuando los precios del crudo estaban altos, las exportaciones petroleras representaban más de 95 por ciento de sus ingresos de divisa dura. Chávez usó las riquezas petroleras para financiar el gasto social, como mayores pensiones y tiendas de abarrotes subsidiadas. Ahora, ese ingreso ya fue abatido.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Si la situación está tan mal ahora, realmente no puedo imaginar como estará en febrero o marzo”, cuando los actuales precios del petróleo “se materialicen en términos de flujo de efectivo”, dijo Francisco J. Monaldi, catedrático de política de energía en la Facultad de Gobierno Kennedy, en Harvard.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Maduro pasó 14 días consecutivos de enero viajando por el mundo, en un esfuerzo por cortejar</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">la inversión y persuadir a otras naciones productoras de que reduzcan la producción y presionen para que el precio suba de nuevo.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Tenemos serias dificultades económicas con respecto a los ingresos del país”, dijo Maduro a la legislatura durante su mensaje anual, que tuvo que ser programado para más adelante debido al viaje. “Pero Dios siempre estará con nosotros. Dios siempre proveerá. Y nosotros recibiremos, y hemos recibido, los recursos para mantener el ritmo del país”.</p></div>"}

Hugo Chávez, elected to four terms as president of Venezuela, used his time in office to dismantle the institutions of Venezuelan democracy and expand his own authority. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has so thoroughly concentrated power in his own hands that many observers now refer to Russia as an “elected dictatorship.” And in Turkey, Mr. Erdogan appears to be following that well-trodden path.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">This phenomenon, which experts call “<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-12-05/how-democracies-fall-apart\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">authoritarianization,”</a> highlights a deep vulnerability built into the structure of democracy itself. Once in power, unscrupulous leaders can sometimes manipulate the political environment to their own benefit, making it more likely that they will be victorious in future contests. By winning those elections, they gain the stamp of democratic legitimacy — even for actions that ultimately undermine democratic norms.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Manipulating and winning elections has become a kind of exploit in the rules of political legitimacy — a way for would-be autocrats to hack the system.</p></div>"}

They also said the American ambassador to Colombia, Kevin Whitaker, <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/world/americas/us-alleged-to-join-in-plot-in-venezuela.html?module=inline\" title=\"Times article\">was involved</a>.

Telesur was a pet project of Hugo Chávez, the former Venezuelan president, who envisioned a strong socialist voice to counteract what he perceived as unbalanced news coverage from major broadcasters like CNN’s Spanish service. In addition to Venezuela, sponsor countries include Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador and Nicaragua. Relations between Argentina and Venezuela have deteriorated since Mr. Macri’s center-right government took office in December 2015.

Y Maduro pudo investirse con el manto de víctima, suscitando el apoyo patriótico en su país, poniendo a la oposición a la defensiva y declarando que “jamás nos arrodillaremos ante este arrogante imperio que ataca y amenaza”.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“La óptica de todo esto es espantosa”, afirma David A. Smilde, profesor de sociología de la Universidad de Tulane y que parte del tiempo vive en Venezuela. “Fue un error estratégico. Yo creo que el gobierno de Maduro va a sacarle mucha ventaja a esto.”</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La declaración de Obama está contenida en una orden ejecutiva que firmó el lunes pasado. Ésta autoriza al gobierno estadounidense a congelar los bienes que tengan en Estados Unidos siete oficiales militares y judiciales venezolanos que Washington identificó como responsables de violaciones de los derechos humanos y del proceso democrático debido.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Aunque Washington esperaba que esa medida concentrara la atención en las deterioradas condiciones de Venezuela, le resultó contraproducente pues le dio nuevo impulso a Maduro. Los críticos temen que Maduro la aproveche como excusa para reprimir aun más severamente a una oposición a la que acusa de aliarse con el enemigo.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">El martes en la tarde, Maduro se presentó ante la Asamblea Nacional para advertir que Estados Unidos estaba dispuesto a atacar a Venezuela y decir que los legisladores debían concederle la facultad de gobernar por decreto, que le permitiría promulgar leyes por su cuenta. La asamblea, controlada por el partido de gobierno, le otorgó a Maduro poderes para gobernar por decreto el domingo durante una sesión especial.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“La agresión y la amenaza del gobierno de Estados Unidos es la amenaza más grande que haya recibido la República Bolivariana de Venezuela, nuestro país”, dijo el martes en medio de aplausos, con la banda presidencial amarilla, azul y roja sobre el hombro y una medalla de oro prendida en el pecho. “Cerremos filas como un solo puño de hombres y mujeres. Nosotros queremos la paz.”</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Habló de las intervenciones estadounidenses en América Latina en el pasado y advirtió que Estados Unidos estaba preparando una invasión y un bloqueo naval de Venezuela.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Venezuela y Estados Unidos han tenido relaciones conflictivas desde hace tiempo, pese a que Washington es el principal comprador del petróleo venezolano, la principal exportación del país.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">El predecesor de Maduro, Hugo Chávez, se complacía en mofarse e insultar a Washington. Maduro ha seguido el ejemplo de Chávez, acusando a Estados Unidos de sabotear la economía y planear derrocarlo, acusaciones que los funcionarios de Washington han rechazado vigorosamente.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Pero en los meses recientes, conforme la economía venezolana tropieza y los precios del petróleo y su popularidad se han desplomado, Maduro ha elevado el tono.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">En Washington, los funcionarios explican que declarar a Venezuela una amenaza a la seguridad nacional fue básicamente una formalidad requerida por la ley para aplicar las sanciones, como lo fue una declaración adicional de que esa amenaza constituía una emergencia nacional para Estados Unidos.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">También subrayaron que las sanciones no son contra el país sino solo contra individuos considerados responsables de violaciones de los derechos humanos y de otro tipo.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“La acción tomada esta semana envía un mensaje inequívoco sobre derechos humanos y corrupción”, señaló William H. Duncan, director de la oficina de Asuntos Andinos del Departamento de Estado, entrevistado por teléfono el miércoles.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Él rechazó las críticas de que la medida hubiera resultado contraproducente.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Esto no es algo de lo que pueda tomarse una foto instantánea; no es cosa de hoy, no es cosa de mañana. Es cosa de lo que suceda en Venezuela a largo plazo”, afirmó. Y agregó: “La declaración del gobierno venezolano de que va a recibir esta emergencia nacional con fuerza simplemente no es verdad.”</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La reacción parece influida en parte por el texto de la orden ejecutiva, que declara que un país pequeño, hundido en una crisis económica, constituye una amenaza para Estados Unidos. Para algunos observadores, eso despierta el espectro de casos anteriores en los que Washington fabricaba amenazas para justificar la acción militar.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Y no fue bien vista en una región que ha resentido la mano pesada de Estados Unidos a través de la historia y que ahora disfruta de una sensación de independencia con respecto a Washington.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Algunos líderes de la oposición venezolana se horrorizaron por la medida estadounidense y afirmaron que los puso a la defensiva.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Venezuela no es ninguna amenaza para ningún país”, afirmó la principal coalición opositora, Unidad Democrática, en una declaración con la que se distanció de la acción estadounidense y expresó su reprobación contra “sanciones unilaterales”.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La Comunidad de Estados Latinoamericanos y Caribeños y miembros de la Unión de Naciones Suramericanas, dos cuerpos regionales, emitieron sus respectivas declaraciones para expresar su preocupación.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">El Presidente Rafael Correa de Ecuador, izquierdista y aliado de Venezuela, fue más enérgico, condenando la medida estadounidense en una serie de mensajes por Twitter.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Ha de ser un chiste de mal gusto, que nos recuerda las horas más oscuras de nuestra América, cuando recibíamos invasiones y dictaduras impuestas por los imperialistas”, señaló Correa. “¿No pueden entender que América Latina ha cambiado?”</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">También Cuba emitió una declaración en la que reafirma su “apoyo incondicional” a Venezuela, aliado vital que la abastece de petróleo subsidiado. Aseguró que las sanciones eran “arbitrarias y agresivas”.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Muchos dirigentes regionales guardaron silencio, pero Smilde indicó que el mayor daño podría ser la falta de apoyo a una campaña dirigida por Estados Unidos para lograr que Venezuela aligere la presión contra la oposición.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Eso hace que sea mucho menos probable que todos los países vayan a hacer declaraciones, a tomar medidas o a hacer cualquier cosa que permitiera examinar las cuestiones de los derechos humanos y la gobernación en Venezuela”, advirtió.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">El año pasado, el gobierno de Obama se opuso a los esfuerzos del Congreso por aplicarle sanciones a Venezuela. Éstas fueron promovidas por los legisladores de los dos partidos que están más estrechamente relacionados con el grupo de presión cubano-estadounidense que propugna tomar medidas más duras contra Cuba y sus dirigentes, Fidel y Raúl Castro.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Pero en diciembre, el Congreso aprobó una ley de sanciones y Obama la firmó al día siguiente de que anunciara que normalizaría las relaciones con Cuba y levantaría muchos de los elementos del bloqueo económico contra La Habana.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La iniciativa cubana le valió a Obama resonantes encomios en toda América Latina – incluso del propio Maduro – y pareció despejar un camino nuevo para la diplomacia estadounidense en la región. Pero esta semana se evaporó al menos una parte de esa nueva atmósfera.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Es una distracción de los verdaderos problemas”, observó Alfonso Marquina, legislador de la oposición en Venezuela. “La semana pasada, la gente hablaba de las colas y la escasez de leche y pañales. Ahora de lo único que habla es de la declaración de Barack Obama.”</p></div>"}

The company said it was pulling out of the country entirely and would sell its assets. It has three factories, about 450 employees and annual sales of about $77 million in Venezuela. Clorox, which is based in California, said in a statement that for nearly three years it had to sell more than two-thirds of its products at prices fixed by the government, even as high inflation caused its costs to rise sharply. It said recent price increases “were nowhere near sufficient.” Clorox sells bleach and other household cleaning products in Venezuela. Venezuela suffers from inflation of more than 60 percent a year and shortages of many basic goods, a situation that could be exacerbated by Clorox’s exit. President Nicolás Maduro, a socialist, says the economic woes are caused by capitalists and political opponents waging an economic war against the country. </p></div>"}

Chávez y su partido, el Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV), ganaron muchas elecciones sin mayor esfuerzo en esta región; su padre, y más tarde su hermano Adán, resultaron electos como gobernadores. Tras la muerte de <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/world/americas/hugo-chavez-venezuelas-polarizing-leader-dies-at-58.html?_r=0&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">Chávez en 2013</a>, la gente de Barinas votó por el sucesor que él mismo había elegido, Nicolás Maduro.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Pero ya pasó la época de bonanza y la economía está en ruinas, así que se acabó el romance.

Rodríguez comentó que fue un chavista leal hasta el 6 de diciembre, cuando por primera vez votó por otro partido. “No es que haya votado por la oposición”, continuó. “Voté en contra de todo lo que está pasando. Es como dijo el presidente, fue una cachetada. Creo que entendió el mensaje”, agregó.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Un cliente que compró una camiseta también dijo que, por primera vez, votó en contra del gobierno.

Éste fue sentenciado a más de trece años de prisión y se encuentra detenido en Ramo Verde, una prisión militar.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“A quienes me conocen, saben la angustia por la que pasé, que no dormía por el dolor y la presión que me daba continuar con una farsa para continuar con ese juicio violándole los derechos injustamente a esta persona”, afirma en el video, de casi cuatro minutos, en el que él aparece mirando directamente a la cámara, de pie ante un muro blanco. Se ve un poco nervioso.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Uno de los abogados de López, Juan Carlos Gutiérrez, publicó un mensaje en Twitter para pedir la anulación de la condena y la libertad para su cliente.

Quiero hacer lo correcto, perder el miedo y decir la verdad. Quiero que sean valientes, levanten sus voces y manifiesten su descontento.”</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">También prometió “decir toda la verdad” sobre lo que ocurrió “antes, durante y después” del juicio de López.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Un seguidor de López que asistió a varias sesiones del juicio confirmó que efectivamente, el hombre que aparece en el video es Nieves.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Cuando se le envió un mensaje de texto al celular de Nieves para preguntarle si se encontraba en Estados Unidos, la respuesta fue “Afirmativo”. Sin embargo, no ha sido posible confirmar si esa respuesta fue enviada personalmente por Nieves.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La otra fiscal que manejó el caso junto con Nieves, Narda Sanabria, colgó cuando este periódico trató de contactarla por teléfono.

Following the march, several hundred young protesters threw rocks at riot police officers and broke windows in a government building. One demonstrator was shot in the head and killed, and protesters blamed armed pro-government supporters. Later, President Nicolás Maduro said a community activist he had known for years had also been killed. Diosdado Cabello, the president of the National Assembly, said the man was killed by “fascists,” a term the government uses for its opponents. Mr. Maduro later said on television, “I alert the world: we are facing a planned coup d’état.” The protests in various cities in recent weeks have sprung from widespread discontent amid increasing economic problems, including high inflation.</p></div>"}

Inesperadamente, dijo Santos, el líder insurgente Rodrigo Londoño intentó echarse para atrás sobre una parte crucial del marco recién negociado.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Santos dijo que en su primera reunión, el miércoles en La Habana, Londoño, líder de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), parecía rechazar un punto de lo que se había negociado la noche anterior, el cual estipulaba un plazo de seis meses para la firma de un acuerdo definitivo que pondría fin a la guerra.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Al recordar el episodio el viernes pasado durante una entrevista en Nueva York, Santos dijo que Londoño se preguntaba si sus negociadores habían aceptado establecer ese período de seis meses, lo que Santos consideraba vital para concluir las negociaciones. El presidente colombiano le dijo a Londoño que había volado hasta La Habana para la reunión porque se había logrado un acuerdo sobre el plazo.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Santos dijo que los dos hombres citaron a los equipos de negociación, y Santos fue quien habló con el jefe del equipo negociador de las FARC. “Dije: ‘¿Qué es esto? ¿No le informaron a este hombre sobre el plazo?’ Y él respondió: ‘Sí, le dijimos.’”</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Dijo que entonces Londoño reconsideró y aceptó seguir adelante. “Ése fue un momento difícil”, afirmó Santos con una sonrisa de alivio.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">El presidente de Colombia expresó que al líder de las FARC le preocupaba que el gobierno utilizara el plazo para presionar a la guerrilla a hacer concesiones de último minuto, pero él le aseguró a Londoño que sólo quería acelerar el fin de las negociaciones. Eso limó asperezas.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Además del plazo, ambos lados anunciaron el miércoles pasado que los insurgentes comenzarán a entregar sus armas 60 días después de la firma del acuerdo definitivo de paz.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Así mismo, expresaron que, según el acuerdo preliminar, los líderes de las FARC y los oficiales militares que habían cometido violaciones a los derechos humanos y otros delitos atroces durante la guerra serían castigados, lo cual supone un avance en un tema que había sido un obstáculo para el acuerdo definitivo.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Santos comentó que el castigo incluiría la reclusión en un sitio especial que él describió como “una instalación austera”, pero “no una cárcel típica con pijama a blanco y negro.”</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Miles de combatientes de las FARC recibirán amnistía conforme al acuerdo, pero varias docenas de líderes de la organización podrían ser sometidos a estos castigos, y entre ellos podría encontrarse Londoño.

The resolution, drafted by the United States, was approved 14-0, with one abstention, from Venezuela. The resolution followed a report this year by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that chlorine bombs had been used in the conflict, even after the Syrian government had signed the global treaty banning such munitions and had agreed to the destruction of its arsenal, which was basically completed by June. Like that report, the Security Council resolution did not specify which side in the conflict had used the chlorine bombs. But critics of the Syrian government, including the United States, have pointed out that the bombs had been seen dropped from helicopters, which are only possessed by the Syrian military. <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\"> </em></p></div>"}

Fue la primera reunión de los líderes de los dos países rivales en la guerra fría.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Obama anunció que la presidenta de Brasil, Dilma Rousseff, había aceptado realizar una visita de estado a Washington en junio, después de que ella cancelara la que tenía programada en 2013 debido a que su teléfono fue intervenido.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Obama incluso platicó brevemente con Nicolás Maduro, presidente de Venezuela, que apenas horas antes había despotricado contra la “injerencia imperialista” de Estados Unidos, amenazando con presentar una petición – que conspicuamente no le presentó a Obama – para exigir que Estados Unidos levantara las sanciones impuestas contra varios funcionarios venezolanos acusados de violaciones de los derechos humanos.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“El mundo de la política y la diplomacia es, en gran medida, un mundo de grandes símbolos”, anunció el periódico mexicano El Universal en un editorial titulado “Una nueva era en América”.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Sin embargo, no todo fue miel sobre hojuelas.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Castro criticó a Estados Unidos de manera extensa por lo que llamó su historial de opresión contra Cuba. Los presidentes de Venezuela, Bolivia y Argentina siguieron sus pasos.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Obama no cumplió con la expectativa de anunciar que Cuba sería retirada de la listas de países que patrocinan el terrorismo. Esa designación desconcierta a muchos líderes regionales e impide que los dos países reabran sus embajadas. Sin embargo, en una región harta de animosidad mutua y perpleja por el bloqueo económico de tiempos de la guerra fría, el simple hecho de que los dos mandatarios se hablaran sin hostilidad fue considerado un notable progreso.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Quizá lo más importante fue el cambio de tono en la reunión de este año. Las acusaciones de la izquierda que tendían a dominar las reuniones anteriores pasaron a segundo plano cuando Castro llamó “honesto” y humilde al presidente estadounidense e incluso se disculpó por haberse dejado llevar por la retórica revolucionaria.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La cuestión ahora será ver cómo aprovecha Estados Unidos el considerable capital político acumulado en la región para abordar algunos asuntos como la corrupción, la impunidad, la fragilidad de la democracia y, en el caso específico de Cuba, la notoria ausencia de democracia.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Obama reconoció lo anterior en su conferencia de prensa, antes de abandonar la cumbre el sábado, advirtiendo que Estados Unidos no ha abandonado la esperanza de democracia en Cuba, solo el enfoque.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Tenemos opiniones muy diferentes de cómo debe organizarse la sociedad y yo fui muy directo con él respecto a que no dejaremos de hablar de temas como la democracia, los derechos humanos, la libertad de reunión y la libertad de prensa”, afirmó Obama.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Pero para Estados Unidos, hacer entender su punto de vista en la región, directa o indirectamente, seguirá siendo un problema conforme los líderes asuman una postura más crítica de “pon primero tu casa en orden”, ante la polarización en Washington y los propios problemas de Estados Unidos con la justicia.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Estas sociedades no reaccionan especialmente a lo que Washington quiere o hace, y no ha sido así desde hace mucho tiempo”, explicó Julia Sweig, académica de Cuba y Brasil de la Escuela Lyndon B. Johnson de Asuntos Públicos en Austin, Texas.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">La influencia de Estados Unidos en la región se ha visto menoscabada, de manera un poco paradójica, por el avance de la democracia desde los años 70 y por el florecimiento de la economía, con Estados Unidos generalmente entre los principales socios comerciales. En consecuencia, los intereses internos ahora superan sistemáticamente a los regionales, especialmente cuando se percibe que Estados Unidos está hablando de manera condescendiente o recurriendo a tácticas de mano dura.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">En sus observaciones a los dirigentes mundiales en la cumbre, Obama reconoció las imperfecciones de la sociedad estadounidense pero también pidió a sus colegas que no abundaran en el pasado ni se sirvieran de Estados Unidos como chivo expiatorio.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Estados Unidos nunca ha pretendido ser perfecto”, afirmó. “Supongo que podemos pasar mucho tiempo hablando de quejas pasadas, y supongo que es posible usar cada tanto a Estados Unidos como fácil excusa por los problemas políticos que pudieran estar ocurriendo en lo interno.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Pero eso no va a producir progreso”, continuó Obama. “Eso no va a solucionar los problemas de los niños que no saben leer, que no tienen suficiente para comer. No va a hacer que nuestros países sean más productivos o más competitivos en la economía global.”</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Con gran frustración, Estados Unidos ha visto tintes de autoritarismo en presidentes elegidos democráticamente en Nicaragua, Venezuela, Ecuador e incluso en Panamá, donde el anfitrión de la cumbre, el Presidente Juan Carlos Varela, fue elegido el verano pasado por ciudadanos irritados ante escándalos de corrupción y el control autocrático de su predecesor, Ricardo Martinelli.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Hasta ahora, todos los esfuerzos de Estados Unidos por llegar a un consenso regional en una amplia agenda – que contempla el cambio climático, el tráfico de drogas y la prosperidad económica, entre otros temas – han sido minados por su negativa a tener relaciones con Cuba y su empeño por aislar a La Habana. En reuniones anteriores, muchos países dedicaron un buen tiempo a hablar de la exclusión de Cuba.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“A pesar de que subsisten diferencias realmente significativas en la región, al hacer a un lado el problema de Cuba creo que veremos a más dirigentes latinoamericanos hablar de democracia y derechos humanos”, indicó Arturo Valenzuela, que fuera subsecretario de Estado para Asuntos Hemisféricos y actualmente es profesor de la Universidad Georgetown.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Él prevé que las potencias regionales, como Brasil, podrían recompensar la reconciliación de Estados Unidos con Cuba asumiendo una posición más firme ante Venezuela.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Valenzuela dijo que algunos temas de la cumbre que recibieron escasa atención de los medios informativos – como la discusión para ampliar las oportunidades económicas, abordar las desigualdades y promover el trabajo de las organizaciones no gubernamentales de la sociedad civil para impulsar reformas básicas – podrían ascender en importancia, incluso en Cuba.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Mientras haya más sociedad civil independiente, ésta podrá presionar más para que haya cambios desde adentro”, precisó. “De ahí es de donde viene todo.”</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Eric Hershberg, director del Centro de Estudios Latinoamericanos y Latinos de la Universidad Americana en Washington, aseguró a su vez que Obama ha estado ganando terreno en la región. No solo haberle tendido la mano a Cuba, sino también por su acción ejecutiva en materia migratoria, para permitir que gente sin autorización para vivir en el país obtenga la residencia legal, afirmó.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Ahora veremos si el gobierno puede mantener ese impulso de compromiso con América Latina y de interés en los temas que le importan a la región”, advirtió.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“Estados Unidos”, agregó Hershberg, “necesita evitar quedar atrapado en disputas improductivas que parecen un regreso a los tiempos de la mano pesada de Estados Unidos en la región.”</p></div>"}

Decades of dictatorship in Brazil left a legacy of hyperinflation and human rights abuses, and political analysts consider the chances of the armed forces returning to power through a coup to be negligible. Still, rising polarization is feeding fears that political infighting could prolong an economic slump. </p></div>"}

He was also aided by the economy’s growth of more than 6 percent last year, driven by strong internal demand and natural gas sales to two of the country’s neighbors, Brazil and Argentina.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Mr. Morales, 54, who after first taking office in 2006 exerted more control over foreign oil and gas companies and raised the taxes and royalties that they pay, has also spent on infrastructure, building roads and an aerial cable-car system connecting La Paz with El Alto, a fast-growing sister city. Social programs include payments to the families of young students and increased pensions for the elderly.</p></div>"}

De cualquier forma, Argentina tuvo relaciones limitadas con Irán durante años, en parte debido a la importancia de la investigación para la gran población judía de la nación.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Después, en 2013, Argentina anunció que había alcanzado un acuerdo con Irán para establecer una comisión conjunta a fin de investigar el ataque. Este movimiento fue apoyado por el Congreso de Argentina, pero enfrentó la dura resistencia de algunos que temían que eso volvería improbable una investigación parcial. Una corte argentina declaró el año pasado que el acuerdo era inconstitucional, y el gobierno prometió que apelaría.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Apenas la semana pasada, Nisman, de 51 años, elevó más las tensiones al acusar a prominentes oficiales argentinos, incluido Kirchner, de conspirar con Irán para encubrir la responsabilidad por el atentado con bomba.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Dijo que el esfuerzo, al parecer, empezaba con una reunión secreta en Alepo, Siria, en enero de 2011 entre Héctor Timerman, el canciller argentino, y Ali Akbar Salehi, el ex canciller de Irán.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Si bien la queja dejó en claro que no se había logrado un trato, argumentando que se vino abajo debido a frustraciones del lado iraní, otros países en la región han ido en pos de intercambios de petróleo por alimento. En el Caribe, Hugo Chávez, el difunto presidente de Venezuela, accedió a suministrar petróleo a la República Dominicana, en parte, a cambio de importaciones alimentarias como frijol negro.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Sin embargo, un trato con Irán conllevaría riesgos adicionales. Un portavoz del Departamento del Tesoro en Washington se negó a comentar sobre si embarques de petróleo de Irán a la Argentina estarían violando las sanciones promulgadas a causa del programa nuclear de Irán. Pero en su sitio web, el Departamento de Tesoro explica que el trueque por petróleo iraní pudiera resultar en sanciones.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">Como sea, durante el periodo en que las negociaciones secretas se estuvieron desarrollando, Irán resurgió como un importante socio comercial para Argentina, en una época en que el país estaba buscando nuevos mercados para sus productos en Oriente Medio y Asia.</p><p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">“El comercio mejoró significativamente entre Argentina e Irán dese 2010, con grandes superávits a favor de Argentina, antes de caer en 2014, dijo Juan Gabriel Tokatlián, experto en relaciones internacionales por la Universidad Torcuato di Tella en Buenos Aires, apuntando a volúmenes de comercio anual superiores a 1,000 millones de dólares al año en esta década, comparado con niveles insignificantes en la década anterior.</p></div>"}
