Do you want a puppet government controlled by Washington?”</p>, <p>Beyond breaking ties with the US, many now expect Maduro to order the arrest of Guaidó or other opposition leaders. Farnsworth said Maduro might also “turn sharpshooters on crowds and try to scare everybody back home”.</p>, <p>If that happened, the US and the international community would be forced to react.

But we will not surrender or betray our country if there is an armed conflict, be it localized, low-level, mid-level, high-intensity, generalized, in one region or a city,” said Maduro, promising to resist what he called efforts to transform Venezuela into a second Libya.</p>, <p>He concluded his address with a swipe at the White House. “Trump, Pompeo, Bolton, Pence: how are you, my friends?” Maduro said sarcastically in English.</p>, <p>During his address,<strong> </strong>Guaidó also boasted of the widespread international backing he had received, reading a long list of governments which had recognized him including those of the United States, Brazil and Colombia.</p>, <p>“A round of applause for the EU!” Guaidó shouted, although the bloc has yet to explicitly back him as interim president.</p>, <p>Guaidó claimed “the entire planet” was backing his movement to end Maduro’s “dictatorship”.</p>, <p>But there are two crucial exceptions: Russia and China, which both have massive military and economic interests in Venezuela, and <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/juan-guaido-venezuelas-opposition-leader-declares-himself-interim-president\">have </a><a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/juan-guaido-venezuelas-opposition-leader-declares-himself-interim-president\">thrown their weight behind Maduro</a>.</p>, <p>On Friday Guaidó said both countries would be welcome in the new post-Maduro Venezuela he was trying to build.</p>, <p>However, Moisés Naím, a Venezuela specialist from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said neither Moscow nor Beijing were likely to turn on Maduro, who came to power in 2013 and has led his country into economic collapse.</p>, <p>Russia would be loth to relinquish a “trophy” foothold in an oil-rich nation that is only a two-and-a-half-hour flight from Miami. China’s financial interests are also too great.</p>, <p>“The moment [Beijing says] they do not think Maduro is the legitimate president of Venezuela – that phrase will cost them $65bn,” he said, referring to the vast debt racked up under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez.</p>, <p>With Donald Trump’s White House backing Guaidó, that means a clash between global powers is possible, Naím said.</p>, <p>“My main concern is that Venezuela becomes a football in this game between powers, where the interests of Venezuelans become secondary.”</p>, <p>In a surprise move on Friday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, named Elliott Abrams, a veteran of Reagan-era cold war policy in Latin America, as special envoy for Venezuela, saying he would accompany Pompeo to a special UN security council session on Venezuela on Saturday, and travel to the region soon.</p>, <p>Abrams, who noted he had last worked in the state department 30 years ago, was intimately involved in Ronald Reagan’s policies in Nicaragua and El Salvador in the 1980s.</p>, <p>In 1991 he pleaded guilty to two counts of misleading Congress over Reagan’s secret plan to bypass the legislature and fund Contra rebels in Nicaragua.</p>, <p>The Mexican president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has said his country is prepared to mediate talks between the two sides, and on Friday, Maduro announced he was prepared to hold talks with his challenger “any place, any time”.</p>, <p>But Guaidó rejected that invitation: “Fake dialogue is no good to anyone.”<br/><br/>“The only solution now is an end to usurpation, a transition government and free elections,” he said.</p>, <p>Supporters who had packed the Plaza Bolívar de Chacao to hear Guaidó speak expressed optimism about the future. “I came to see history in the making.

The disbursement and delivery of the assistance could be complicated by the US government shutdown, and the practical difficulties of delivering food and medicine to a territory with hostile security forces.</p>, <p>“You could start trying to move foreign assets and flow of incomes from the US into the hands of the interim government under Juan Guaidó, but it is far too early to know if that is feasible,” said Ivan Briscoe, the Latin America and Caribbean programme director for the International Crisis Group.</p>, <p>“You could set up a foreign bank accounts, but if it goes to opposition leaders without any control over coercive powers, it just increases the risks of persecution and jail,” Briscoe said.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, a complete oil embargo imposed on the Maduro government would have blowback effects on the US economy.</p>, <p>Chet Thompson, the president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, wrote to Trump to warn that “sanctions on Venezuela’s energy sector would like harm US businesses, workers, and consumers while failing to address the very real issues in Venezuela.”</p>, <p>Another option would be designate Venezuela a “state sponsor of terrorism” which would lead to more sanctions and travel bans, but it would be hard to justify factually, and would be unlikely to have a serious impact on Maduro’s inner circle, who are already subject to extensive US sanctions.</p>, <p>Moises Rendon, associate director of the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas\">Americas</a> programme at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, argued that the US administration was right to provide maximum support to the national assembly at a time of mass street protests and a last-ditch opposition effort to force a return to democracy through peaceful means.</p>, <p>Rendon said the Maduro regime would be vulnerable to the loss of US revenues from oil sales, and the US is one of the few customers that pays in hard currency.</p>, <p>“Maduro would be in dire financial circumstances. Russia doesn’t have the bandwidth to support him and China is concerned about previous loans that have not been repaid,” he said.</p>, <p>“There is unprecedented pressure on Maduro. He hasn’t seen domestic and international pressure synchronised against him like this.”</p>, <p>But Rendon added such pressure represented a high-stakes gambit. “If these measures don’t work out and if Maduro survives we could see an isolated regime like North Korea, but with oil and narco-trafficking.”</p>, <p>More immediately, a showdown has developed around the US embassy in Caracas. Maduro has given the diplomats and their families until Saturday afternoon to leave the country while Pompeo told them to stay put, warning of “appropriate actions to hold accountable” anyone endangering the US mission and its staff.</p>, <p>It is unclear whether the administration had always intended to leave the embassy staff as potential hostages in the midst of a volatile standoff.</p>, <p>After top Maduro ally, Diosdado Cabello, suggested that electricity or gas supply to the embassy district could be cut off, and former US officials questioned whether the lives of diplomats and their dependents were being put at risk by an administration gamble, the state department on Thursday night, ordered all non-essential government employees out of Venezuela.</p>, <p>Asked about the safety of US diplomats on Thursday, Trump said only: “We’re looking at Venezuela. It’s a very sad situation,” noting how it had gone from being very rich to very poor.</p>, <p>Eva Golinger, a Venezuelan-American lawyer, writer, and a former adviser to Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chávez said that Trump personally had little interest in Venezuela. She said he had been persuaded to take the extraordinary action against Maduro by hawks in his administration and in Congress, in particular Republican senator and former presidential candidate Marco Rubio.</p>, <p>“Trump has no plans.

China is Venezuela’s largest creditor, prompting concerns that as Venezuela’s economy spirals, state assets could fall into Chinese hands, as was the case with Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port.</p>, <p>It is in Beijing’s interest to support Maduro, given that a new government could refuse to honour Venezuela’s debt obligations to China. Maduro met China’s president, Xi Jinping, last year and toured Mao Zedong’s mausoleum in Beijing, and the countries agreed on £3.8bn in loans and more than 20 bilateral agreements.</p>, <p>Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, phoned Maduro to offer his support on Thursday, later telling a press conference he was shocked that the US had backed Guaidó.</p>, <p>“You will respect the results of elections. Trump’s remarks shocked me, as someone who believes in democracy,” he said. “I called Maduro on the way back from Russia. I told [him] very clearly: ‘Never allow anti-democratic developments. Stand tall,’” he said.</p>, <p>Turkey’s foreign minister issued a warning about Guaidó’s declaration. “There is an elected president and another person declares himself president, and some countries recognise this. This may cause chaos,” Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu told the A Haber news channel. “We are against the isolation of countries. I hope the situation will be solved peacefully.”</p>, <p>Mexico, part of the 14-member Lima Group, departed from the regional bloc’s call for democratic transition and said it would stick to its “<a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/r_velascoa/status/1088223018181103616\">constitutional principles of non-intervention</a>”.</p>, <p>It joined Uruguay, the only other prominent Latin American country still recognising Maduro, in calling for additional talks between the government and opposition to find a peaceful solution. Previous talks brokered by the Vatican on the Venezuelan situation broke down.</p>, <p><a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico\">Mexico</a> had previously criticised Venezuela but its new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has returned the country to its traditional foreign policy of not weighing in on the internal affairs of other countries and expecting the same silence in return.</p>, <p>Iran denounced events in Venezuela, saying the opposition’s claim there that it held the presidency was a “coup” and an attempt to take power unlawfully.</p>, <p>The foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said: “Islamic Republic of Iran supports the government and people of Venezuela against any sort of foreign intervention and any illegitimate and illegal action such as attempt to make a coup d’état.” </p>, <p>Cuba expressed its support for Maduro, with the state newspaper Granma saying that by recognising Guaidó as interim president, Donald Trump was “directing a coup d’état”. Cuba is hugely dependent on Venezuelan petroleum paid for with doctors.</p>, <p>The UK broke European ranks on Thursday and sided with the US. “This regime has done untold damage to the people of Venezuela, 10% of the population have left Venezuela such is the misery they are suffering,” the foreign secretary Jeremy Huny said in a statement issued in Washington. “So the United Kingdom believes <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a> is the right person to take Venezuela forward. We are supporting the US, Canada, Brazil and Argentina to make that happen.”</p>, <p>The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said talks in Venezuela were needed to avoid the political crisis spiralling out of control.</p>, <p>“What we hope is that dialogue can be possible, and that we avoid an escalation that would lead to the kind of conflict that would be a disaster for the people of Venezuela and for the region,” he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p>, <p>“Sovereign governments have the possibility to decide whatever they want. What we are worried [about] with the situation in Venezuela is the suffering of the people of Venezuela.” </p>, <p>Maduro has presided over a deepening economic crisis that has left millions of people in poverty as the oil-rich country faces shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicine. An estimated 2.3 million people have fled the country since 2015, according to the UN, and the International Monetary Fund says inflation will hit <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/PCPIPCH@WEO/WEOWORLD/VEN\">10 million per cent</a> this year.</p>]'}\n",

The US, Canada and a string of Latin American countries recognised the young leader in quick succession.</p>, <p>And late on Saturday Guaidó gained support from a key military official.

If there are not fresh &amp; fair elections announced within 8 days UK will recognise him as interim president to take forward the political process towards democracy. Time for a new start for the suffering ppl of Venezuela.”</p>, <p>The foreign secretary’s comments came shortly before the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, also spoke out in favour of new elections in Venezuela, echoing similar comments from France’s president, Emmanuel Macron; the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez.</p>, <p>The interventions reinforced a clear split in the international community, where Maduro has continuing support from two key members of the UN security council, Moscow and Beijing.</p>, <p>On Friday, a Labour spokesman called for a negotiated settlement and warned against British intervention. “We oppose outside interference in Venezuela, whether from the US or anywhere else,” he said. “The future of Venezuela is a matter for Venezuelans.”</p>, <p>Jeremy Corbyn has strongly criticised foreign attempts to undermine Maduro.</p>, <p>The bid for power by Guaidó, head of the country’s national assembly, is the most direct challenge to Maduro’s rule following years of protests at home and international efforts to isolate his regime which has presided over a growing humanitarian crisis fuelled by falling oil prices and government mismanagement.</p>, <p>Maduro has vowed to defend his socialist rule and accused his opponent of working with the US to overthrow him and install a “puppet government”. The president, who faced rare mass protests last week, still has the support of the military.</p>, <p>Pompeo, who was expected to address a security council meeting last night that was also due to be attended by the Venezuelan foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, said he hoped the “international community will disconnect their financial systems from the Maduro regime”.</p>, <p>Russia had objected to the council’s focus on Venezuela, according to UN diplomats. The country’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said US actions were an “obvious call for a coup d’etat” which would threaten peace.</p>, <p>The meeting came a day after Guaidó vowed to remain on the streets until his country had secured a transitional government.</p>, <p>“They can cut a flower, but they will never keep spring from coming,” Guaidó told supporters on Friday, alluding to a similar phrase from the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/23/chile-neruda-airport-rename-outrage-admitted-rape-memoirs\">Chilean poet, Pablo Neruda</a>.</p>, <p>Both sides attempted dialogue last year, but talks collapsed as Maduro called an early election that excluded the country’s most popular opposition leaders.</p>, <p>Analysts fear the standoff between the two men could set the scene for further violence after days of political turmoil.</p>, <p>The office of the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, has said it has called for an investigation after receiving credible reports that security forces, or members of pro-government armed groups, shot at least 20 people during protests on Tuesday and Wednesday. </p>, <p>According to the Penal Forum human rights group, 369 people have been detained since Monday.</p>, <p>On Wednesday, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/venezuela-maduro-guaido-defense-minister-civil-war\">Maduro gave </a><a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/venezuela-maduro-guaido-defense-minister-civil-war\">US diplomats 72 hours to leave the country</a>, an order Washington said it would defy by keeping the embassy open, though it told non-essential staff to leave.</p>]'}\n",

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/23/enezuela-trump-president-juan-guaido-maduro-recognition-news-latest\">immediately greeted by</a> the US and Canadian governments.</p>, <p>Guaidó first signalled that he was willing to mount a serious challenge to the country’s president in early January when <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro\">Nicolás Maduro</a>, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\"

denounced as fraudulent.</p>, <p>The inauguration was met with a chorus of international disapproval, and Guaidó, just six days into his post, told the world <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/11/venezuela-maduro-juan-guaido-assume-presidency\">he was ready to assume the presidency until free and fair

of American States – but also prompted fears it could provoke a fresh crackdown on the opposition.</p>, <p>Maduro, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/on-the-road-venezuela-20-years-after-hugo-chavez-rise\">who has overseen deepening economic and political turmoil</a>, made light of his relatively inexperienced challenger. “A lot of people in Venezuela are going to ask what is this ‘Guaidó’?” he joked in a Friday night TV address.</p>, <p>But days later, Guaidó was briefly detained by the intelligence services – something Maduro’s administration blamed on rogue operatives.</p>, <p>“Look what they are doing,” Guaidó told a rally of supporters following his release. “They are desperate in [the presidential palace] Miraflores … We are survivors, not victims!”</p>, <p>Raised in La Guaira, a port city 20 miles from Caracas, Guaidó cut his political teeth during 2007 student protests against Maduro’s late predecessor <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\">Hugo Chávez</a>, who was then seeking to consolidate power.</p>, <p>Chávez put various constitutional amendments, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\"

<p>Guaidó had just finished his first full term as a legislator, having been elected in 2015.</p>, <p>Though largely defined by his opposition to Maduro, Guaidó supports a market economy and granting fiscal autonomy to regional governments, in line with the party’s policies.</p>, <p>“Guaidó is a fighter and an eternal optimist … he’s humble and sincere,” said Freddy Guevara, an opposition leader and friend of Guaidó, in a telephone call from the Chilean ambassador’s residence in Caracas, where he is seeking asylum. “He gets along with everyone and doesn’t have the typical profile of a politician.”</p>, <p>Many in Venezuela thought Maduro had successfully neutered the assembly in 2017, when <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\"

Maduro.</p>, <p>“He was incredibly brave and now runs risks that he’ll be jailed, tortured or need to go into exile,” said David Smolansky, an opposition leader, who was also forced to flee <a

Maduro also attacked the European Union.</p>, <p>“Stop, Europe … Don’t come again with your old colonialism. Don’t come again with your old aggression. Don’t come again, old Europe, with your old racism,” he said. “There’s been enough enslavement – the looting that you subjected us to for 500 years … Respect <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> … or sooner rather than later you’ll pay the historical price.”</p>, <p>But there was also public acceptance that <em>chavistas – </em>implicated in <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/world/americas/venezuela-andrade-corruption-bribes.html\">a succession of eye-watering corruption scandals</a><em> </em><em>–</em> had a hand in Venezuela’s collapse. “I want a new start for the Bolivarian Revolution … I want us to correct the many mistakes we have committed,” Maduro said, calling corrupt <em>chavistas</em> a greater threat than US imperialism. He promised “a great moral revolution” and “a profound correction of the mistakes of the Bolivarian revolution” in his second term.</p>, <p>“We are the heirs of a great legacy. We cannot fail and we will not fail,” Maduro concluded to loud applause.</p>, <p>Amid heavy security, red-clad <em>chavistas</em> gathered outside the court in downtown Caracas, surrounded by posters reading: “<em>Yo soy presidente</em>” – “I’m the president”.</p>, <p>“I identify with Maduro because he’s a humble man, like me. My ideology is what brings me here today,” said Jesús Alcalá, a 44-year-old craftsman.</p>, <p>Others were obliged to appear. “I was forced to come today,” said one 30-year-old housing ministry employee and who asked not to be named for fear of dismissal. “I’m not happy with this situation,” she confided. “I have three kids and I really struggle to feed them. I’m planning to leave the country this year.”</p>, <p>On state television channels the Socialist party faithful lined up to defend their embattled leader. “Lots of countries are saying that our president is illegitimate – they are wrong,” a woman named as Sory Ramos told Telesur.</p>, <p>María Alejandra Díaz, a member of Venezuela’s powerful constituent assembly, urged Maduro’s opponents to reject what she called foreign plots to unseat her leader.</p>, <p>“Do not invite the demon into your home. Never ask a foreign power to intervene or invade,” she warned. </p>, <p>Maduro’s term is due to last six years but many doubt he will make it that far, such are the economic and political headwinds buffeting his country. Last year inflation reportedly hit 1.35 million percent while a mass exodus that has seen almost 10% of the country abandon the country continued.</p>, <p>“Economically we are in a death spiral,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group. “There is a real sense that the whole country is grinding to a halt – and a cold analysis has to reach the conclusion that it is impossible to go on like this.”</p>, <p>But with the opposition “shattered into a thousand pieces” Gunson admitted there was no sign of even a midterm political or economic fix. “Some people say the government may collapse because it has collapsed the whole country and there is no way it can continue. But if there is nothing to take over from it then even if it’s collapsed it will remain in power.”</p>, <p>David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group, said Maduro hoped forging “an alternative network” of partnerships with authoritarian countries including China, Russia and Turkey would enable him to weather the storm.</p>, <p>“They think … that if they can just keep holding on, within a couple of years they can wait this out and countries will get tired of pressuring Venezuela eventually things will normalise.

Addressing Trump, he asked: “Why would you want a repeat of Vietnam?”</p>, <p>The EU was unable to come to a collective stance on Venezuela last week when the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement\">Five Star wing of the Italian coalition</a> government objected to recognition of Guaidó.</p>, <p>There are divisions on the issue not just within the Italian coalition, but also within the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement\">Five Star Movement</a> (M5S). Luigi Di Maio, Italy’s deputy prime minister and the leader of M5S, defended his refusal to recognise Guaidó as interim president saying he “had not been elected by the people”.</p>, <p>So far the US and about 20 other countries have recognised, or are on the brink of recognising, Guaidó. But Russia, China, Turkey and Cuba have defended Maduro, rejecting outside interference as orchestrated by Trump. Canada and the Lima Group of Latin American countries, which are aiming to find a solution to the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> crisis, recognised Guaidó on 23 January.</p>, <p>Much of the Ottawa meeting will be taken up with the humanitarian consequences of the crisis. Freeland’s diplomatic service has played a backroom role in helping organise the opposition to coalesce around Guaidó. She said: “The Maduro regime is now fully entrenched as a dictatorship.”</p>, <p>On Sunday Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, spoke to the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, to coordinate the call for elections. He has said the aim of the Ottawa meeting is to push for peace, democracy and stability.</p>, <p>One proposal is to seize “corruptly obtained” overseas assets belonging to members of the Maduro regime and use the cash to ease the humanitarian crisis as Venezuelan refugees flee abroad, such as tocountries such as Colombia.</p>, <p>The Labour party in the UK has not recognised Guaidó, despite his being a member of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://www.socialistinternational.org/\">Socialist International</a>, though it has stepped up its criticism of Maduro, once a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn.</p>, <p>The shadow attorney general, Lady Chakrabarti, speaking on Sunday to Sky News, said: “Last year’s reporting on Venezuela is pretty damning and that’s in terms of disappearances, that’s in terms of crushing dissent, that’s in terms of reports of torture, of prisoners and political prisoners, and it is completely unacceptable.</p>, <p>“I think it is incumbent on people like me, as a member of the left, to call out governments and states of the left because human rights have to be applied with an even hand.”</p>]'}\n",

Then came the sudden political shake-up that has convinced many Venezuelans the curtains are coming down on Nicolás Maduro’s catastrophic six-year reign. Everything changed.</p>, <p>“You can smell the change,” said the 22-year-old student, repeating it as if he almost couldn’t believe it was true. “You can smell the change!”</p>, <p>In the wake of Venezuela’s latest upheaval, Bellorín, from Barlovento, an hour east of the capital, has scrapped plans to join the exodus that has robbed his oil-rich country of a tenth of its citizens.</p>, <p>Instead, yesterday morning he was one of tens of thousands of dissenters who streamed onto the streets to demand Maduro’s exit. “It’s essential we stay … because what is coming is good and it guarantees our future,” he said, grinning cheek to cheek.</p>, <p>Octavio González, a fellow student leader at the Central University of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> in Caracas, said he was also convinced the sun was setting on Maduro’s “macabre and murderous dictatorship”.</p>, <p>“It’s a breaking point … I think the end is near,” said González, 24. “If it’s a question of days or months, who knows? But you can be sure it won’t make it through the year. It can’t.”</p>, <p>Richard Utrera, 46, a father-of-two was at the protest carrying a placard reading: “When fear dies, freedom is born.” He said: “We feel joy – for the first time there is hope because we are getting help from overseas.”</p>, <p>His wife, Estilicia de García, said: “It’s been so long since we felt this way … We must carry on fighting – most of all for our kids.”</p>, <p>As Venezuela enters the third week of the latest and most serious <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/venezuela-protests-maduro-guaido-latest-news\" title=\"\">bid to dislodge Maduro</a>, there is a palpable elation among government opponents that Hugo Chávez’s widely loathed heir might finally be on his way out. Their optimism was fuelled yesterday by a video message from a serving general, Francisco Yanez of the air force’s high command, calling on the armed forces to rebel against Maduro and recognise his challenger, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\" title=\"\">Juan Guaidó</a>.</p>, <p>Yanez – the first general to support Guaidó since he declared himself interim president in late January – claimed that “Ninety percent of the armed forces are not with the dictator – they are with the people,” adding: “The transition to democracy is imminent.”</p>, <p>Maduro however has shown little sign of being prepared to stand down, and many observers are not expecting any imminent transition.</p>, <p>Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said that – aside from the move by Yanez – the fact the military had remained loyal suggested Maduro was not necessarily likely to be ousted soon.</p>, <p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if we see some kind of continuation of the status quo. This is a regime that has had 20 years to buy the loyalty of the cornerstone of Venezuelan politics, which is the armed forces. Unless that changes, I just don’t see a transition,” he said. Eva Golinger, a US writer and former Chávez ally who first met Maduro about 15 years ago, said it was impossible to predict what might come next: “Every day is a new day.”</p>, <p>But she also doubted that Maduro – who continues to enjoy the backing of Russia and China, as well as the military – was about to fall. “There is certainly concern [within Maduro’s administration]. But I’m not seeing a weakening in the government to the point at which the dozen or so in Maduro’s circle are going to give it up. There is no sign of that. They are not planning on relinquishing power,” Golinger said.</p>, <p>Guaidó begs to differ. At the unveiling of an opposition blueprint for Venezuela’s rescue on Thursday, he was inundated by members of the media and hundreds of admirers who now lionise him as a potential saviour. “We are in the streets and we will remain in the streets until the usurpation ends,” Guaidó declared, urging people to join what he called “the biggest march in the history of Venezuela and our continent”, yesterday.</p>, <p>José Toro Hardy, a Venezuelan economist who helped devise the economic recovery plan, said “very specific historical circumstances” meant the stars had aligned for those seeking change. In particular, unambiguous support from Donald Trump means Maduro’s position is under threat.</p>, <p>“Venezuela has been driving the wrong way down the highway of life and we must take the right direction again,” Hardy said.</p>, <p>Golinger said she was troubled by Trump’s apparent resolve to remove Maduro and feared failure to achieve that through political pressure could lead to military action. “It would be hard to see this administration – that is so much into winning – take this as a loss and not get Maduro out. That would be a huge defeat for Trump. I can’t even imagine. I think he would send in the troops.”</p>, <p>That, Ramsey warned, would not only be a logistical nightmare for the US but “ultimately a bloodbath”.</p>, <p>Protesters like Bellorín and González said they were aware of the potential dangers and hoped Maduro agreed to step down. “Nobody in this country is prepared for a war,” González said.</p>, <p>On the eve of yesterday’s protests, Maduro visited a special-forces training ground with defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, to oversee a parade of anti-riot troops. “We are facing a historic battle,” Maduro said. “The greatest political, diplomatic and economic aggression Venezuela has faced in 200 years.</p>, <p>“I will stand firm and I can tell you that we will win.” Maduro then shouted what has become the refrain of his epic struggle to retain power: “Always loyal!”</p>, <p>“Never traitors!” the troops bellowed back. That message was undermined just hours later by Yanez’s announcement on social media that he was abandoning Maduro.</p>, <p>González, the student leader, said he was certain more would follow: “No one follows a corpse into the grave.”</p>, <p><a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a> is described as an American puppet waging an illegal coup against their Bolivarian revolution, by the president’s allies.</p>, <p>“A whippersnapper,” top chavista Diosdado Cabello scoffed last week.</p>, <p>Guaidó’s Twitter profile describes him as a civil servant and engineer – as well as interim president of the republic.</p>, <p>But for millions of despairing people, the 35-year-old is a source of hope. Just 15 when “El Comandante” <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\">Hugo Chávez</a> was first elected in 1998, Guaidó is from La Guaira, a port city just north of the capital, and belongs to Voluntad Popular (Popular Will) a centrist opposition party.</p>, <p>He took his first steps into politics in 2007, during anti-Chávez protests, and was taken under the wing of Leopoldo López, one of the country’s best-known and most combative opposition leaders.</p>, <p>With López under house arrest it has fallen to Guaidó – first elected in 2015 but virtually unknown until he became head of the opposition-run national assembly in early January - to lead the latest attempt to unseat Maduro. On 23 January, he declared himself interim president based on an article of the constitution he says permits him to claim leadership if the presidency is left “vacant”.</p>, <p>“We have woken up from a nightmare to dream of a better country,” he told supporters last week. Many are now banking on him to build just that.</p>]'}\n",

They will be facing security forces expected to be under strict orders to prevent the supplies coming through, regardless of who is carrying them.</p>, <p>Many analysts fear that will mean bloodshed, as the military has largely stayed loyal to the government although, in a political boost for the opposition, Chavez’s former spy chief <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/world/americas/hugo-carvajal-maduro-venezuela.html\">turned against Maduro this week,</a> denouncing him as dictator and calling for aid to pass.</p>, <p>Rocío San Miguel, a Caracas-based defence analyst, said: “It’s hard to see a situation this weekend that avoids the military stopping that aid from coming in. The military structures towards that border make it impossible that they will let that aid through.”</p>, <p>By early Friday morning, there had been one death and several injuries reported after members of an indigenous community which supports Guaidó tried to stop a military convoy heading to the Brazilian border. One woman died from her wounds and 13 others were injured, according to local politician Jorge Perez.</p>, <p>On the Colombian border, opposition supporters desperate for change said they were undeterred by the threat of violence. “This is a dictatorship that has already taken everything from us, our food, our homes, our medicines,” said Rafael Alfonzo Silva, who had come to assist with logistics, having fled <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> two years ago. “They have nothing left to take.”</p>, <p>Despite bellicose threats to the existing regime from American officials,<a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/18/trump-venezuela-nicolas-maduro-juan-guaido\"> including Donald Trump</a>, Guaidó and his supporters have insisted they do not want a foreign military intervention or violence on the ground.</p>, <p>“We are here because we have to ensure that humanitarian aid enters Venezuela, however that happens,” said Dignora Hernández, a legislator from the Vente Venezuela opposition party, who had also travelled to the border. “We are not talking about an intervention like the ones you see in films, with helicopters and planes landing, we are talking about authorising – according to the constitution – a peaceful mission to allow humanitarian aid to pass.”</p>, <p>Guaidó himself has not appeared for several days, as the opposition apparently play cat and mouse with authorities, making public announcements about events then changing plans at the last minute.</p>, <p>Although much of the media focus has been on the Colombian border, where flows of migrants are high and the two planned concerts have drawn international attention, aid has been stockpiled in several other locations including the border with Brazil and the island of Curaçao. A ship loaded with supplies is also sailing from Puerto Rico.</p>, <p>The pro-Guaidó concert in Colombia has attracted major stars – including Maluma, Alejandro Sanz and Luis Fonsi, famous for the global hit Despacito – and at least two presidents – the leaders of Colombia and Chile – for a six-hour event that backers have compared to the 1985 Live Aid event in London and Philadelphia.</p>, <p>Overnight and into Friday morning hundreds of Venezuelans streamed over the border to attend, many shouting Guaidó’s name or “Let Maduro fall”, as they approached the site.</p>, <p>Carlos Alvarez, 45, from the central town of Maracay, said: “I’m here to make history. We are done with this regime.” He slept on the street after crossing over on Thursday, fearing the border would be closed on Friday.</p>, <p>There were reports that supporters had been bussed in from around the country to attend Maduro’s rival concert, held on the other side of the bridge that separates Colombia and Venezuela.</p>]'}\n",

In 2017, mass anti-Maduro protests convinced many that Chávez’s heir was finished, only for him to emerge stronger.</p>, <p>Guaidó insisted the 2019 revolt was different, largely because of its international backing and sky-high discontent among citizens and members of the military suffering the consequences of their country’s economic collapse.</p>, <p>“The fall of the Berlin Wall took a day … It was a barrier and it came down. I believe we are on the verge of something similar,” he said.</p>, <p>Guaidó claimed up to 90% of Venezuela’s population opposed Maduro and 80% of the armed forces wanted political change.

But there could always be a first,” he said, evoking the 1948 assassination of the Colombian politician Jorge Eliécer Gaitán that sparked <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Violencia\">a decade of bloodshed</a> known as <em>La Violencia</em>.</p>, <p>Guaidó, a father-of-one whose calm and eloquent nature remind some of Barack Obama, admitted he was engaged in a high-stakes gamble. “Doing politics in Venezuela is a risk and you can pay with your life,” he said, pointing to more than 400 political prisoners and 1,000 exiles.</p>, <p>Might jail or exile be his future if Venezuela’s military refuse to abandon Maduro?</p>, <p>“Or perhaps even death,” Guaidó replied. “As we say in Venezuela: ‘May God have mercy upon us’,” he added, knocking twice on the table in front of him. “Obviously, there is a latent risk.”</p>, <p>With that, Guaidó strode out of the 17th floor office down a corridor whose walls are inscribed with handwritten tributes to his mentor, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/leopoldo-lopez-venezuelan-elite-opposition-guaido\">Leopoldo López</a>, who was jailed in 2014 for his role in the struggle against Maduro.</p>, <p>One message stood out from the calligraphy: “<em>El futuro nos pertenece</em>” it said. “The future belongs to us.”</p>, <p><em>Additional reporting by Patricia Torres</em></p>]'}\n",

It’s not that we lack resources. It is that we have too many thieves.”</p>, <p>There was a carnival atmosphere as the crowd surged down Avenida Francisco de Miranda past constant reminders of Venezuela’s economic collapse: abandoned construction sites, graffiti denouncing poverty and hunger, and a paint-spattered government building from which a CCTV cameras and a giant image of Maduro stared down on protesters.</p>, <p>Street hawkers sold Guaidó T-shirts and hoodies and politically charged baseball hats emblazoned with the slogan: “Make Venezuela <em>D’Pinga </em>[Shit hot] Again”.</p>, <p>“We have already won,” boasted Abrahan Fernández, a 28-year-old student activist from the opposition party Primero Justicia. “Today we have defeated the dictatorship and we have a president called <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a>.”</p>, <p>But there was also anger – and anxiety – that Maduro was still in power.</p>, <p>“How are things in my community? We have no water, no cleaning, no food,” said Fonseca, who carried a banner reading: “The struggle cannot just be on Twitter and Instagram. The struggle is in the streets!”</p>, <p>Asked what her message to Maduro would be, Fonseca responded with a barrage of expletives.</p>, <p>Rose Patricia Valdivia, 63, said she was encouraged residents of working class areas traditionally loyal to Chavismo<em> </em>had joined the revolt. “For the first time the <em>barrios</em> are taking to the streets,” she said of the redbrick slums whose residents have been <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/venezuela-faes-special-forces-nicolas-maduro-barrios\">targeted by special forces</a> for daring to protest.</p>, <p>Her husband, Juan José Pérez, said he saw only one solution to the crisis: the departure of Maduro “and all the Chavistas and Maduristas around him who have led us into this disaster”.</p>, <p>But with Maduro refusing to step down and no sign yet of Venezuela’s military turning on him, Valdivia admitted people power alone would not be enough. “So we have to pressure them, force them to go.”</p>, <p>As the rebellion against Maduro enters its forth week, that reality is beginning to dawn on many members of Venezuela’s newly energized opposition who had hoped he would already have fallen.</p>, <p>Luis Pedro España, a sociologist who is part of an opposition group planning Venezuela’s post-Maduro reconstruction, admitted Maduro and his inner circle were only likely to give up power if military power obliged them to. “We are depending on a military action – or the threat of a military action – internal or external,” España said.</p>, <p>España said he believed a political transition was only now likely if the armed forces acted against Maduro. “Might that something be violent? Yes. Might it not be violent? I hope it won’t be violent,” he said.</p>, <p>Maduro paints the rebellion – and Guaidó – as part of an “imperialist” plot to destroy the Bolivarian revolution he inherited from Hugo Chávez. His officials staged a counter-rally through downtown Caracas on Tuesday in a show of support for their embattled leader.</p>, <p>“They want to intervene because we have the greatest riches on earth,” complained Jaime<strong> </strong>González, 75,<strong> </strong>a retired<strong> </strong>carpenter and Maduro supporter. “They want to invade to take all of these riches off us.”</p>, <p>In <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias-america-latina-47165102\">an interview</a> with the BBC, Maduro accused the channel of being part of a “war campaign” against Venezuela and claimed his international foes had invented a fake humanitarian crisis to justify military intervention. “Do we have problems? Of course. But Venezuela is not a country of famine.”</p>, <p>On Tuesday, Venezuelan troops occupied a bridge on the Colombian border in order to block the entry of humanitarian aid that Maduro claims is being used by the opposition in order to unseat him.</p>, <p>Maduro’s second-in-command, Diosdado Cabello, visited the border region and accused Venezuela’s “traitorous” opposition of seeking to bring bloodshed and violence to the region.</p>, <p>“It is neither aid, nor is it humanitarian!” Cabello, the president of Maduro’s all-powerful constituent assembly, told a rally of supporters.</p>, <p>Addressing protesters in Caracas, Guaidó said the aid would enter Venezuela on 23 February, and called on the country’s armed forces to let the shipments in.</p>, <p>He insisted Maduro’s fall was now inevitable. “When 90% of the population wants change, there is no way to stop it.”</p>, <p><em>Additional reporting by Patricia Torres in Caracas and Joe Parkin Daniels in Cúcuta</em></p>]'}\n",

A few hours later, Maduro appeared and was greeted with chants of: “<em>Maduro, amigo! El pueblo está contigo!</em>” “Maduro, our friend! The people are with you!”</p>, <p>But as a revolt against Chávez’s heir enters its fourth week, political observers and former Chavista insiders say that claim to popular support has never been flimsier.</p>, <p>“Chavismo is broken … If they carry on like this, they will have nothing left,” said Nicmer Evans, a longtime loyalist who split with the movement in 2013, and believes that Maduro must now resign if that movement is to survive.</p>, <p>Those descending on Plaza Bolívar insisted they remained devoted to Maduro, who inherited Chávez’s revolution after his death in 2013 and now faces the fight of his political life after a stunning challenge from opposition leader <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a>.</p>, <p>Little known until just a few weeks ago, Guaidó declared himself Venezuela’s rightful leader on 23 January and is now recognised as Venezuela’s interim president by more than 40 nations, including the United States.</p>, <p>“I have only one president and that’s <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro\">Nicolás Maduro</a>,” said Maryuri González, a 25-year-old from La Victoria, a city an hour west of Caracas. “I never voted for anyone called Guaidó.”</p>, <p>But experts say support for Maduro is evaporating, with many of those publicly backing him doing so because they depend on government jobs or food handouts <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-food/for-poor-venezuelans-a-box-of-food-may-sway-vote-for-maduro-idUSKCN1GO173\" title=\"\">known as “clap” boxes</a>.</p>, <p>“He knows he has lost the people. He knows the streets and the <em>barrios</em> [poor areas] are no longer with him,” said Moisés Naím, Venezuela’s former trade minister and a vocal critic of <em>Chavismo</em>.</p>, <p>Evans estimated Chávez, who first took office 20 years ago and governed until his death in 2013, had been able to rely on a hardcore support base of about 30% of voters. For years those diehard disciples lived by the maxim: “<em>Con hambre y sin empleo, con Chávez me resteo</em>” – “Even hungry and jobless, I’ll stick with Chávez.”</p>, <p>Under Maduro – who has presided over one of the most severe economic collapses in recent history – that support base had plummeted to about 10%, Evans thought.</p>, <p>And he predicted that figure would shrink further as <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/trump-venezuela-sanctions-oil-pdvsa-maduro-guaido\" title=\"\">sweeping US oil sanctions</a> devastate the economy. “The risk is that if Maduro stays in power, Chavismo will disappear. The Chavistas know this – they know it very well,” he said.</p>, <p>Many believe that leaves Chavistas with an urgent dilemma – ditch Maduro in order to keep their political movement afloat, or sink along with him.</p>, <p>Evans said a fierce internal battle is now raging within the Socialist party, with a trio of Chavistas – Diosdado Cabello, Héctor Rodríguez and Tareck El Aissami – topping the list of likely Maduro replacements. “They know that keeping Maduro in power is a risk to the movement itself … [But] if Chavismo can get away from Maduro, maybe it can rebuild and be one of the many alternatives in the country in the medium-term.”</p>, <p>Evans – <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1092824034167918595\" title=\"\">who has brokered talks</a> between former Chávez ministers and Guaidó – is one of several “ex-Chavistas” urging Maduro to step aside in order to save a political movement once feted for its dedication to the poor.</p>, <p>In an interview this week with <em>El País</em>, Chávez’s former oil minister, Rafael Ramírez, said that Maduro was “out of time”. “The country stands on the edge of an abyss, fundamentally because Maduro’s situation is unsustainable,” said Ramírez, who split with Maduro in 2017 and appears to be plotting a comeback from exile in Europe.</p>, <p>“He has to go, because he is destroying the country and will continue destroying the country,” Ramírez added. Gino González, a member of Maduro’s all-powerful constituent assembly, said that his movement needed to stand together to resist an imperialist plot to pillage Venezuela’s natural resources by installing a puppet president.</p>, <p>“We might have differences in the way we think things should be done … [but] we must be unified,” González said. “If the North American empire sticks its nose into this country, it will be its last war … the empire will end right here.” </p>, <p>Evans said he feared that some around Maduro were obsessed with the idea of an epic showdown with the US that risked destroying not only Chávez’s political movement but also his country. Maduro’s best option was to step down, call elections, and, in doing so, give Chavismo a chance of survival.</p>, <p>Evans admitted that some in the opposition were bent on “exterminating” Chavismo but he believed that the movement had to be involved in Venezuela’s reconstruction “for the wellbeing of the country”. “It needs to exist as a political party – just like all the others parties.”</p>, <p>Guaidó signalled an understanding of that <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/08/venezuela-juan-guaido-central-university-speech-maduro-protests\" title=\"\">during a speech</a> to supporters on Friday, telling them that “all sectors” would be represented in a transitional government once Maduro was gone.</p>, <p>With the circle apparently closing on Maduro, there was defiance and indignation among devotees in Plaza Bolívar. “The United States wants to own the whole world,” fumed Fernando Gómez, 77, as he queued to add his name to Maduro’s “Hands off Venezuela” petition. </p>, <p>But there were also hints that some would not mourn the political passing of Chávez’s inheritor. Gómez admitted that it was hatred for US president Donald Trump – a warmongering “psychopath” and a “nutcase” – that had brought him out more than affection for his own leader.</p>, <p>“It’s not so much support for Maduro as rejection of the United States wanting to invade,” he said.</p>, <p><strong>2013 April</strong> A month after the death of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\">Hugo Chávez</a>, Maduro is elected president by a narrow margin.

This is complete insolence.”</p>, <p>In an apparent attempt to project indifference to Venezuela’s latest political convulsion, Maduro also <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/NicolasMaduro/status/1089336048210067456\">tweeted</a> a video of himself dancing to regional <em>joropo</em><em> </em>music with the first lady, Cilia Flores. “Nothing can stop us!” he wrote.</p>, <p>Guaidó admitted that while international support was growing, his movement to unseat Maduro still lacked crucial backing from Venezuela’s military. Last week Venezuela’s defence minister <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/24/venezuela-maduro-guaido-defense-minister-civil-war\">slammed</a> what he called Guaidó’s shameful “criminal plan” to destabilise Venezuela and pledged loyalty to Maduro.</p>, <p>The opposition leader pointed to <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-embassy/venezuelan-us-defense-attache-breaks-with-maduro-as-diplomats-leave-idUSKCN1PK0RV\">the defection of Venezuela’s top military envoy to the US</a> on Saturday and the discharge of 3,600 military officials since last year as proof support was “emerging” within the armed forces. “But we have yet to consolidate these [gains] in order for us to really be able to execute the process that will lead us to a transitional government and, ultimately, to fresh elections,” Guaidó conceded.</p>, <p>Some observers worry the intensifying political crisis has the potential to spark a civil war, if different military factions back different leaders.</p>, <p>“I am worried about a country that can fragment under different chieftains and warlords and generals and narco-traffickers [and guerrilla groups] and … <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> becoming like a tapestry of different power centres,” the country’s former trade minister, Moisés Naím, told the Guardian last week.</p>, <p>But Guaidó tried to soothe fears of conflict. “I don’t think we will reach that point.

With little personal interest in Latin America, the US president has allowed policy towards Venezuela to be steered by hawks in his administration – including his vice-president, Mike Pence, and the national security adviser, John Bolton – and in the Senate.</p>, <p>The Republican senator\\xa0<a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio\">Marco Rubio</a>, whose Florida electorate includes an increasing number of Venezuelan exiles, has been an important influence, and appears to have suspended criticism of Trump in return for hardline policies towards Cuba and Venezuela.</p>, <p>Diplomats at the state department advocating dialogue have been overruled in favour of a policy orientated around regime change.</p>, <p>Trump himself has\\xa0<a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/11/donald-trump-venezuela-crisis-military-intervention\">mused about a military option</a>, and the unanswered question is how the administration hopes to follow through on its gambit to recognise Guaidó in the absence of mass defections in the armed forces.</p>, <p>That does not seem to have been thought through.</p>, <p>The US has already imposed significant sanctions on Maduro’s ruling circle. A full oil embargo would bring more devastation to the Venezuelan people and could backfire on the US economy. The administration could ultimately be left with the choice between abandoning Guaidó or risking armed confrontation.</p>, <p>Fresh anti-Maduro demonstrations have been called for this week and Guaidó said he hoped marchers would not be met with deadly repression, as happened during <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/25/venezuela-protests-riots-frontline-caracas-nicolas-maduro\">the last major round of demonstrations</a> in 2017. “This is no time for more deaths or more sacrifices.” Human rights groups <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/01/25/venezuela-arrests-killings-anti-government-protests\">report</a> that at least 26 people have been killed since the latest phase of protests began last week.</p>, <p>Guaidó said he felt confident about the future and urged Venezuelans to trust the country was turning a corner. “There are risks … but there will be bigger rewards.</p>, <p>“Everywhere I turn I get a smile … we all know that the situation is dire but regardless of this I have received encouragement. It’s been great to see a newfound hope,” he added.</p>, <p>“I’ve been getting calls from childhood friends who left the country and who tell me they finally have hope that they will return, and they tell me they will use everything they have learned living abroad to rebuild the country.”</p>, <p>However, concerns over Guaidó’s international backers – particularly in Brazil and the US – remain.</p>, <p>Following Bolsonaro’s election last October, Guaidó, a member of the centrist Voluntad Popular party, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jguaido/status/1056685527678812166\">praised</a> what he called Bolsonaro’s “commitment to and for democracy [and] human rights”.</p>, <p>Latin America specialist Miguel Tinker Salas said it was “astounding” to see Bolsonaro and Trump painting themselves as advocates of “democracy and fair play in Venezuela”.</p>, <p>“The US has no moral standing on these issues and neither does Bolsonaro and Brazil,” said Salas, a signatory of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://portside.org/2019-01-25/open-letter-united-states-stop-interfering-venezuelas-internal-politics\">an open letter</a> attacking what it branded a US attempt to topple Maduro.</p>, <p>Guaidó, who rejects claims that he is a pawn in a US-backed coup attempt, said his immediate priority – apart from securing a peaceful political transition – was addressing Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis: “Our focus is helping people.”</p>, <p>Another prime concern was rescuing Venezuela’s once-great oil giant, Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), which oversees the world’s biggest crude reserves but whose production <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-venezuela-oil/\">has collapsed</a> under Maduro. “PDVSA is in a state of emergency,” Guaidó said.</p>, <p>Once “the usurper” (Maduro) was gone, Guaidó said free elections needed to be held “as soon as possible” after political prisoners had been freed and members of Venezuela’s swelling diaspora could all be registered.</p>, <p>“That takes time but we need to take care of these [things] in the shortest period of time,” he said.</p>]'}\n",

After mass protests in 2014, he targeted opposition leaders, such as Guaidó’s political patron, Leopoldo López, who <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/18/venezuela-opposition-leopoldo-lopez-surrenders\">was arrested and barred from running for office</a>.

Demonstrations were met with bloody repression: over 120 protestors killed and hundreds more injured. The crackdown prompted international condemnation but Maduro succeeded in consolidating his power.</p>, <p>That approach seems less workable today. Although Maduro retains the backing of allies such as Russia, Turkey and Cuba, he has come under unprecedented international pressure including from a dozen Latin American countries.</p>, <p>Military top brass has made a show of support for their commander in chief, but there has been a string of defections by junior officers. At the weekend, Maduro’s military attache to the embassy in Washington DC became the most senior figure to switch sides, followed by the consul in Miami.</p>, <p>Rank and file soldiers have felt the economic impact of the country’s crisis, but Maduro has rewarded senior officers with positions in government and the state oil company PDVSA. But <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/trump-venezuela-sanctions-oil-pdvsa-maduro-guaido\">US sanctions on the company unveiled this week</a> could change that. </p>, <p>If Maduro is to survive this current challenge, he’ll have to keep the military onside, and that means finding a way to keep them paid.</p>, <p>Another way out of the current standoff – though not one that would benefit the Venezuelan people – would be a military coup that leaves a general or some sympathetic civilian in charge. That would likely mean a return to business as usual: kleptocracy, mismanagement and authoritarianism.</p>, <p>Potential successors in the military would be either Maduro’s lieutenant Diosdado Cabello or defence minister Vladimir Padrino López, both of whom command military support but are widely despised by many Venezuelans. Civilian candidates could be vice president Delcy Rodríguez or her predecessor Tareck El Aissami. Both are international pariahs.</p>, <p>In any case, a change at the top would not placate the opposition, now emboldened and set on restoring democracy. And if political options are closed for good, there is a strong risk that opponents of the regime would turn to the armed struggle – and Latin America has a troubled history vanquishing insurgencies.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, unless a new leader could rebuild the country’s wrecked economy, millions will continue to flee, further destabilizing the region.</p>, <p>A transition back to democracy would be the easiest way out of the current standoff but Maduro has little to gain and everything to lose by surrendering power. He has intimated he is open to negotiations, mediated by an international broker, though has previously used such talks to stall for time and divide the opposition.</p>, <p>Even if Maduro agrees to leave, he will not want to risk any reckoning over his authoritarian rule – and neither will thousands of public and military officials who enabled him.</p>, <p>Guaidó has <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/guaido-tries-to-dent-maduro-grip-on-venezuela-military-with-amnesty-offer\">promised an amnesty</a> to members of the armed forces who “contribute to the reestablishment of democratic order”.</p>, <p>There are pragmatic reasons for such a move, said Dimitris Pantoulas, a Caracas-based consultant, who offered Colombia’s 2016 peace deal with the leftist Farc rebels as a possibly example.</p>, <p>“You cannot have ten of thousands going into exile or be judged by ordinary courts – it would be chaos,” he said.</p>, <p>Maduro and his inner circle would most likely have to leave the country, but it is unclear where he could go. His only major international allies are Russia, China, Cuba and Turkey, and it is unclear what could motivate any of them to receive him.</p>, <p>Maduro has long characterised his country’s woes as the result of a decades-long imperialist campaign of “economic war” waged by the US. It has served him well, rallying his generals and what little support he has behind the flag. Now, however, some analysts fear that hawks in Washington DC and Caracas could drive the two countries into a real conflict.</p>, <p>The Venezuelan crisis has prompted the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/venezuela-brazil-hunger-highway\">biggest migration in Latin America’s modern history</a>, and neighbouring countries are desperate for a swift resolution. “If the trend were to worsen, the pressure for a military strike to end the deadlock would likely increase,” said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based consultant with Crisis Group. “And that is an outcome we should all be trying to avoid.”</p>, <p>At the moment, such a conflict is still seen as a distant possibility, but conceivably, the rightwing governments of Brazil and Colombia could sign up to a US-led coalition against Maduro.</p>, <p>Such a war – the first war between two South American countries in more than 80 years – would be protracted, bloody and fraught with unpredictable variables, but when Donald Trump’s national security advisor John Bolton was photographed holding a legal pad with the note “5,000 troops to Colombia”, it prompted concerns that the US is seriously considering such an option.

In the speech to the Sandringham Women’s Institute, she spoke of the virtues of “respecting” the other person’s point of view. It echoed her Christmas address when she touched on the same theme, telling the nation: “Even with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding.” Her speech came as Philip Hammond told business leaders <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/24/philip-hammond-urges-business-leaders-to-accept-brexit-result\">they needed to accept the result of Britain’s EU referendum</a> and warned that a failure to implement it would damage the country’s political stability.

Bristol was 57 when he died, having moved from Grenada to the UK in 1968, when he was eight. He was sacked from his cleaning job last year because he had no passport, and was denied benefits. The original inquest found he died of natural causes but the assistant coroner declined to consider evidence that stress was a contributing factor, something his family challenged.</p>, <p><strong>‘Needle in a haystack’</strong> – The remains of the famous British explorer Matthew Flinders, who led the first circumnavigation of Australia, have been <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/25/grave-of-matthew-flinders-discovered-after-200-years-under-london-station\">uncovered near London’s Euston station</a>, 200 years after he was buried. The graveyard is being excavated to make way for the high-speed line between London and Birmingham. Only a small proportion of the 40,000 bodies being exhumed from St James’s cemetery, behind the station, have been identified so far, making the discovery of Flinders’ remains earlier this month a “needle in a haystack” find, according to the project’s lead archaeologist.</p>, <p>Last year investigations around the world showed that historical sexual abuse within the Catholic church had been covered up for decades.

Plus: the Guardian’s Tom Phillips on Juan Guaidó’s attempted take over in Venezuela.</p>, <p>Kidnapping and ransom insurance was created in the 1930s, but it wasn’t until the 60s that it began to really catch on, following a spate of kidnappings in Europe by groups such as Eta in Spain, the Red Army Faction in Germany and the Red Brigades in Italy. The appeal was simple: in the event of a kidnapping, the insurance would provide reimbursement for ransom payment.</p>, <p>Nearly a century later, London is the global centre for kidnap and ransom insurance, but it has not always been a comfortable fit. Official policy in the UK (and US) – unlike in many other countries – is to never make concessions to kidnappers, refusing to negotiate with terrorists, pay ransom or make concessions. The logic of that policy is that paying ransom puts a target on the back of British citizens, increasing the risk of future kidnappings. But those taken sometimes die as a result. <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/25/business-of-kidnapping-inside-the-secret-world-of-hostage-negotiation-ransom-insurance\">Joel Simon asks if it is time to rethink</a>.</p>, <p>Maurizio Sarri claimed Carabao Cup <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/24/chelsea-tottenham-hotspur-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\">progress beyond Tottenham</a> on penalties into the first major final of his coaching career <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/24/maurizio-sarri-chelsea-win-players-enthusiasm\">will breathe new “enthusiasm” into Chelsea’s season</a>.

Now it is impossible,” said Solano, who said that many protesters were former Chávez supporters. “Now they were shouting they want Nicolás [Maduro] to leave.”</p>, <p>This week’s developments have surprised analysts, who had thought the opposition to be too fractured – and Venezuela too divided on class lines – to bring about change.</p>, <p>“These protests are remarkable. The fact that people are coming out to protest across class lines reveals one thing: just how widespread the level of utter disgust with Maduro is in Venezuela today,” said Geoff Ramsey, the assistant director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America. </p>, <p>“If any kind of democratic solution to the crisis is possible, the opposition will have to make a case for themselves among the base of the ruling party, offering them concrete proposals that reflect their interests.”</p>]'}\n",

Mike Pence later made clear the US would use “the full weight of our diplomatic and economic pressure”. US officials said the US would look at ways to transfer Venezuelan assets and oil revenues to Guaidó and the opposition-run national assembly.</p>, <p>Maduro responded with defiance, cutting off relations with the US and ordering all US diplomats to leave the country within 72 hours.</p>, <p>“We are defending the right to the very existence of our Bolivarian republic,” Maduro told supporters at a rally outside the Miraflores presidential palace in Caracas. He urged them to resist “at all costs” what he called a coup attempt being orchestrated by “the coup-mongering, interventionist gringo empire” and the “fascist right”.</p>, <p>“They intend to govern <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> from Washington,” Maduro shouted from the palace’s people’s balcony. “Do you want a puppet government controlled by Washington?”</p>, <p>Guaidó issued his own statement, urging foreign embassies to keep their diplomats in the country. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, later said the US would abide by Guaidó’s directive and ignore Maduro’s order to withdraw its diplomats.</p>, <p>MPs in Russia, a major Venezuelan ally, criticised US moves against Maduro. “The United States is trying to carry out an operation to organise the next ‘colour revolution’ in Venezuela,” Andrei Klimov, the deputy chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the upper house of parliament, said, using a term for the popular uprisings that unseated leaders in Georgia, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan.</p>, <p>Another committee member, Vladimir Dzhabrailov, said: “I do not think that we can recognise this – it is, in essence, a coup.”</p>, <p>Turkey and Cuba and Bolivia’s Evo Morales have also offered their support for Maduro.</p>, <p>In a statement, 11 of the 14 members of regional bloc the Lima Group said they supported the start of a democratic transition in Venezuela “in order to hold new elections, in the shortest time”. The three holdouts included Mexico, which has maintained a principle of non-intervention under leftist president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, as well as Guyana and St Lucia.</p>, <p>The EU’s foreign affairs representative, Federica Mogherini, called for work to begin on holding free and credible elections. She said: “The people of Venezuela have massively called for democracy and the possibility to freely determine their own destiny. These voices cannot be ignored.”</p>, <p>On Wednesday, thousands of protesters clogged the streets of the capital, Caracas, with further demonstrations across the country.</p>, <p>The protests came as Guaidó, the head of the national assembly, raised his right hand and said: “I swear to assume all the powers of the presidency to secure an end to the usurpation.”</p>, <p>The 35-year-old lawmaker, said his surprise move was the only way to rescue Venezuela from “dictatorship” and restore constitutional order.</p>, <p>“We know that this will have consequences,” Guaidó, 35, told the cheering crowd. “To be able to achieve this task and to re-establish the constitution we need the agreement of all Venezuelans,” he shouted.</p>, <p>Oil-rich Venezuela is mired in economic and political turmoil, with hyperinflation <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2018/jul/25/venezuela-inflation-crisis-nicolas-maduro\">rendering the bolivar currency practically worthless</a>. Shortages in food staples and basic medicines are rampant, and crime is widespread. More than 3 million Venezuelans have fled, causing consternation across the continent.</p>, <p>The country’s opposition has struggled to find a strategy against Maduro, however, and analysis warned that Guaidó’s gutsy move was potentially dangerous: the opposition may have won international recognition, but it has no control over state bodies or the security forces.</p>, <p>“It is absolutely clear that the strategy was decided by the US government and the Venezuelan opposition, so they share the risk,” said Dimitris Pantoulas, a Caracas-based political analyst and consultant. “The government reaction will come shortly and it remains unclear if the people are ready to defend Guaidó with their lives”</p>, <p>In a statement, Trump described the national assembly as the “only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people” and warned Maduro not to resort to violence.</p>, <p>“We continue to hold the illegitimate Maduro regime directly responsible for any threats it may pose to the safety of the Venezuelan people,” he said.</p>, <p>Asked if would consider a military option if Maduro refused to cede power, the US president said: “We’re not considering anything but all options on the table. All options, always, all options are on the table.”</p>, <p>Pence was more specific in a television interview on Wednesday night. “The United States is going to continue to bring the full weight of our economic and diplomatic pressure until freedom and democracy and fair elections are restored for the people of Venezuela,” he told the Fox Business Network.</p>, <p>Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said Maduro’s government was “now fully entrenched as a dictatorship”, and called on him to hand power to the national assembly until new elections were held.</p>, <p>The sudden developments came as tens of thousands joined marches across the country, which followed two nights of violent protests in working-class neighbourhoods of Caracas – once bastions of support for the government – and the apparent foiling of an armed uprising by members of the national guard.</p>, <p>Morelia Armini, a saleswoman from Caracas, could barely contain her joy at the day’s developments. “This is a wonderful thing,” she said, after watching to Guaidó take the oath. “Like a phoenix, this is the rebirth of Venezuela.”</p>, <p>Wednesday also marked the anniversary of the 1958 uprising that overthrew the military dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez – symbolism that was not lost on María de Jesús, a social worker from Caracas who was born on the day of the 1958 rebellion.</p>, <p>“I was born in democracy,” she said on her way to the march in Caracas. “I want my freedom; this is a dictatorship.”</p>, <p>Across town, several hundred supporters held a rival march in support of Maduro. Though it was dwarfed in size by the opposition protest, those in attendance were in a buoyant mood.</p>, <p>“We are here to support our president and defend our resources,” said Ana Medina, who works for the state oil company PDVAs, as salsa music blasted from loudspeakers. “We know that other countries are against Maduro because they want to take over our resources.”</p>]'}\n",

She added that similar lobbying efforts with the Obama administration – including a meeting with the then vice-president Joe Biden in February 2015 – had achieved less.</p>, <p>The restrictions on López – and the fact Tintori’s passport was revoked in September 2017 – have required him to delegate many diplomatic responsibilities to exiles.</p>, <p>One such figure is David Smolansky, a former mayor from López’s party, People’s Will, who fled Venezuela in disguise in late 2017 when a warrant was issued for his arrest and now lives in Washington.</p>, <p>Another is Carlos Vecchio, López’s friend and fellow a Harvard graduate, who arrived in Washington in 2014, also after fleeing Venezuela.</p>, <p>“This effort we are now seeing really got going when we decided not to participate in the fraudulent elections last May,” said Vecchio, who was recently appointed Guaidó’s ambassador to the US. “That’s when we decided to get a real movement going around the world not to recognise Maduro as legitimate on 10 January.”</p>, <p>Desperate to build momentum, Vecchio and Smolansky worked their contacts in Washington, including Rubio and the Democrat Bob Menendez.<strong> </strong>People’s Will members also took advantage of the 175 embassies hosted in the US capital, speaking with diplomats from around the world, especially Latin America.</p>, <p>“We started working to get people not only to declare Maduro as illegitimate, but to recognise the leader of the national assembly as the constitutionally legitimate interim president of Venezuela,’ Vecchio said.</p>, <p>The campaign was further boosted last year when Brazil and Colombia elected rightwing leaders, Jair Bolsonaro and Iván Duque, both of whom had campaigned promising a harder line towards Maduro.</p>, <p>The multi-pronged diplomatic assault yielded the results López had been waiting years for when <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a> received a call from Pence on 22 January.</p>, <p>A US official with knowledge of the call said Pence promised Guaidó that the Trump government would back him if he took the presidential oath amid mass demonstrations planned for the next day.</p>, <p>Pence placed the call after receiving Trump’s blessing at an Oval Office meeting also attended by Rubio, three other Florida Republicans and the national security adviser, John Bolton.</p>, <p>Guaidó took the oath – and the US was as good as its word, recognising him as Venezuela’s president within minutes.</p>, <p>The move took many diplomats and members of the opposition by surprise, but by the evening of 23 January, a dozen Latin American countries and Canada – who Tintori had also been lobbying – had followed suit.</p>, <p>“Guaidó’s courageous efforts to restore democracy and constitutional order come at great risk to himself and his family, but he has broad international support as nations worldwide recognise Maduro as Venezuela’s criminal usurper,” Rubio told the Guardian, adding that the US would continue to play an important role, through diplomatic recognition, financial and humanitarian aid.</p>, <p>For now, the focus remains on Guaidó – a previously little-known politician transformed into an overnight celebrity.</p>, <p>But those close to López doubt he will stay in the background forever. And some suspect it is only a matter of time until he seeks the keys to the presidential palace himself.</p>, <p>“Obviously there are aspirations. There are people that want to be there, right?” said Juan Andrés Mejía, another prominent party member and López ally. “In People’s Will we have a candidate, who is Leopoldo. Juan [Guaidó] is playing a huge role at this point, which is allowing a transition to happen.”</p>, <p>Asked if López was still the party’s official candidate, Mejía replied: “Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely.”</p>, <p>But some believe López’s ambitions could be derailed by the sudden rise of his protege. Guaidó has <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/02/venezuelans-take-to-streets-in-push-to-force-maduro-from-power\">captured the hearts and minds of millions of Venezuelans</a>, and López may find his dreams of leading Venezuela have to be put on hold.</p>, <p>“Guaidó is a messianic figure now,” said Vanessa Neumann, president of the risk analysis firm Asymmetrica and occasional adviser to various opposition members. “If he calls free elections, Guaidó will win. He will be our president for the next six years – and Leopoldo will hate that.”</p>, <p>Mejía insisted that the end – restoring democracy to Venezuela – was more important than the means and hinted Guaidó could still emerge as the opposition candidate to be Venezuela’s next president. “We will see. Maybe he will be [the candidate] and that would be great … who knows?”</p>, <p>“Our objective is very clear – free and fair elections in the shortest time possible and from there on, we are willing to discuss the rest,” Mejía added.</p>, <p>When asked if López still harboured ambitions to become president, Tintori said: “Leopoldo has always fought for Venezuela, even when he was silenced and jailed in horrible conditions. He is a public servant with a plan for this country, and that is what we are seeing with everything he has done with Guaidó.”</p>]'}\n",

Venezuela has an economic crisis … Many people have been tricked into leaving.”</p>, <p>Asked if the challenge to his rule from the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, and his international allies including the US, meant he was now “against the ropes”, Maduro admitted he was facing a “tough” fight against powerful opponents.</p>, <p>“They use sledgehammers instead of boxing gloves,” Maduro said of the US, which he claimed was seeking to topple him to seize Venezuela’s oil.</p>, <p>“But it’s like David against Goliath,” Maduro went on. “We have our secrets too – and we have our sling. David’s sling is in our hands.”</p>, <p>Maduro also sent a message to his opposition challenger Guaidó, who declared himself Venezuela’s legitimate interim president on 23 January, sparking what many believe could be a final showdown between the two sides.</p>, <p>“Think carefully about what you are doing,” he said, urging Guaidó “to abandon his coup-mongering strategy”.</p>, <p>Asked if he feared that Venezuela could be plunged into war by the crisis, Maduro said: “Everything depends on the extent of the madness and aggression of the northern empire and its western allies.

US refineries are also banned from buying crude from PDVSA unless the money is paid into accounts not tied to Maduro.</p>, <p>The worry in Venezuela, however, is that the measures will only lead to more suffering in a country already mired in hyperinflation and chronic shortages of food staples and medicine.</p>, <p>“In all my years, I’ve never seen something so drastic,” said Carlos Fuentes, an engineer waiting in line for fuel. “If the gasoline disappears it will be just another problem within all this chaos.”</p>, <p>Analysts say the goal of the sanctions is to increase the people’s suffering and trigger even larger protests than those that have rocked Venezuela over the last few weeks.</p>, <p>“The US is hoping that the huge outcry will be the silver bullet that finally kills Maduro’s regime,” said Geoff Ramsey, assistant director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America. “But as we have learnt from Cuba, authoritarian regimes can be very resilient.”</p>, <p>Opposition protests have outnumbered those in favour of the government, but Maduro has maintained the crucial support of the military by offering senior members positions in government and PDVSA. The sanctions also aim to hit those kingmakers in their wallets, although the vast illegal economies which they also run – from drug trafficking to illegal mining and extortion – will be unaffected.</p>, <p>“So much money comes out of the ground in Venezuela that finds its way into the regime’s pockets, it’s hard to see these sanctions doing much apart from increasing the suffering of normal people,” Ramsey went on to say.</p>, <p>PDVSA, so long Venezuela’s economic lifeline, is unlikely to be able to weather the current storm: while the country may have the world’s largest proven oil reserves, it has been increasingly racked by fuel shortages due to crumbling infrastructure.</p>, <p>The crude that comes out of the ground is high in sulphur, which can only be processed into gasoline at certain refineries. With Venezuela’s refineries in disrepair, oil is shipped to the US and refined there, before being sold back to the troubled nation to meet demand at the pumps. In the first eight months of 2018, imports from the US rose 76% to 125,000 barrels a day, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p>, <p>“This is a company that has been completely mismanaged since Chávez stacked it with loyalists,” said Gilberto Morillo, a consultant who served as PDVSA’s chief financial officer until 2003, when Hugo Chávez, Maduro’s late predecessor, began the practice of staffing the company with political appointees.</p>, <p>Morillo added that Maduro will try to court other crude buyers in an effort to alleviate the impending crisis, but those calls are likely to be rebuffed. “Countries with the right refineries, like India, or countries in Africa, are on the other side of the globe … shipping costs would be huge for them.”</p>, <p>PDVSA’s woes could also isolate Maduro from his chief patron, Russia, which invests up to $20bn in Venezuela, experts say, of which a significant portion goes to PDVSA.</p>, <p>Russian energy giant Rosneft has loaned more than $6bn to PDVSA. That loan is being repaid through deliveries of crude oil to Rosneft through 2019, and is dependent on PDVSA’s ability to pump oil.</p>, <p>Declining production in Venezuela last year led to reports that Igor Sechin, an influential ally of Vladimir Putin, personally flew to Caracas in November to complain to Maduro and signaled the Kremlin’s growing impatience.</p>, <p>The collateral for part of that loan is PDVSA’s 49.9% stake in the US refiner Citgo, and new US sanctions against PDVSA could make it difficult for Russia to take ownership in the case of a default. Rosneft also holds joint stakes with PDVSA in a number of oil fields in Venezuela.</p>, <p>China, another vital ally to Maduro, is also showing consternation, with PetroChina planning to scrap a $10bn oil refinery in the south of the Asian superpower, Reuters reported on Thursday.</p>, <p>Meanwhile as the fuel queues drag on in Caracas, some drivers welcomed the sanctions, even as they prepare for tough times. “Are we going to suffer? Sure, but they are necessary evil,” said María Alexandra Villasuso, a video producer, as she filled up her vehicle. “The government is already drowning, and if the ship sinks, so be it. At some point we’ll float again.”</p>]'}\n",

Chávez drove through a wide range of social reforms as part of his Bolivarian revolution, financed with the help of high oil profits – but he also bypassed parliament with a new constitution in 1999.</p>, <p>The muzzling of parliamentary democracy – and the spread of corruption and mismanagement in state-run enterprises – intensified after 2010 amid falling oil prices. Chávez’s “economic war” against shortages led to hyperinflation and the collapse of private sector industry. The implosion in the economy between 2013 and 2017 was worse than the US in the Great Depression.</p>, <p>In an attempt to stabilize the economy and control prices of essential goods, Chávez introduced strict controls on foreign currency exchange, but the mechanism soon became a tool for corruption.</p>, <p>When <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/05/hugo-chavez\">Chávez died of cancer</a>, his place was taken by his foreign minister, Nicolás Maduro, who has intensified his mentor’s approach of responding to the economic downward spiral by concentrating power, ruling by decree and political repression.</p>, <p>Lacking Chavez’s charisma and personal popularity, and having been bequeathed <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/on-the-road-venezuela-20-years-after-hugo-chavez-rise\">an already crippled economy</a>, Maduro has dealt with discontent largely by neutralising other branches of government.</p>, <p>He has packed the country’s supreme court with loyalists who simply overturned laws passed by the national assembly that the president opposed, including a measure freeing political prisoners.</p>, <p>Elections for provincial governors were suspended, and the court even ruled in favour of dissolving the legislature, but the decision was reversed in the face of national and international outcry.</p>, <p>In July 2017, Maduro followed Chávez’s example by holding elections to a constituent assembly, with candidates from government-approved lists, imbued with powers to bypass or dismantle any dissenting state institution.</p>, <p>It was a way of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/19/venezuela-crisis-deepens-maduro-strips-opposition-held-parliament-power\">bypassing the opposition-led national assembly</a>, elected in the country’s last free poll, in May 2016. Maduro’s own attorney general objected and has since fled to Colombia.

Guaidó was made chairman of the national assembly on 5 January because it was the turn of his party, Voluntad Popular (People’s Will). At 35, he is a junior member of the party but its leaders are either under house arrest, in hiding or in exile.</p>, <p>His relative obscurity has been an advantage in a country where the opposition has <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/andes/venezuela/71-friendly-fire-venezuelas-opposition-turmoil\">generally failed to distinguish itself</a>, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/venezuela-lopez-tintori-maduro/541752/\">losing its nerve</a> at critical moments, succumbing to infighting, and getting involved in a failed coup against Chávez in 2002.</p>, <p>Guaidó stakes his claim to the presidency on a clause in the constitution that states that the chair of the national assembly is allowed to assume interim power and declare new elections in 30 days if the legislature deems the president to be failing to fulfil basic duties or to have vacated the post.</p>, <p><a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has a weakness for autocrats, but Maduro has been an exception.

A full oil embargo would bring more devastation to the Venezuelan people and could backfire on the US economy. The administration could ultimately be left with the choice between abandoning Guaidó or risking armed confrontation.</p>]'}\n",

No sooner had the young pretender, Juan Guaidó, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/27/juan-guaido-venezuela-has-chance-to-leave-chaos-behind\" title=\"\">declared himself interim president last month</a>, ostensibly supplanting the corrupt old revolutionary, Nicolás Maduro, than the world piled in. The Trump administration insisted all countries must “pick a side” and back the “forces of freedom”. Russia denounced a US-backed “coup”. China, Latin American neighbours, Britain and the EU all scrambled for position, in accordance with their particular interests and prejudices.</p>, <p>In the past week, this international tug-of-war over Venezuela’s future has grown increasingly dangerous – and unhelpful – as protesters and security forces face off on the streets and the political impasse deepens. <br/>John Bolton, the US national security adviser, is threatening “serious consequences” (meaning military intervention) should Guaidó be harmed or opposition supporters attacked. Maduro warns that the US could face a second Vietnam. </p>, <p>Bolton, along with Mike Pence, the US vice-president, and Marco Rubio, a rightwing Republican senator from Florida, are the prime movers in Washington’s latest regime-change adventure. An Iraq war hawk and leading neoconservative, Bolton has an ideological axe to grind. His updated “axis of evil”, now Iraq and North Korea have supposedly been sorted, comprises Cuba, Nicaragua and <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> (but he is still gunning for Iran).</p>, <p class=\"pullquote-paragraph\">In 1913, Woodrow Wilson declared: ‘I am going to teach South American republics to elect good men’ – he didn’t</p>, <p>Rubio speaks for rightwing Cuban-Americans who abhor the Caracas-Havana alliance and hold sway in southern Florida, a key 2020 election battleground. As for Trump, he is on record since 2017 as favouring a “military option” in Venezuela. For him, this sudden ramping up is a welcome distraction from his Mexico border wall defeat.</p>, <p>Whatever Bolton says, Trump will not necessarily escalate. He has a record of backing off when the going gets tough – witness his Syria troop withdrawal plan. Foreign interventions are not Trump’s thing. And the fierce opposition of his sinister chum, Vladimir Putin, will give him pause. Moscow is offering to mediate, which, if it happened, would dent US prestige in its own “backyard”. For Putin, Venezuela is Washington’s Ukraine. He would dearly like to turn the tables and mete out a reciprocal humiliation.</p>, <p>Maduro says Trump covets Venezuela’s oil – and given last week’s US bid to siphon off the state oil company’s revenues in the name of democracy, that sounds plausible – but so, too, does Russia, whose extensive Venezuelan interests also include arms sales.</p>, <p>China’s sole concern is commercial stability, not regime legitimacy. A parallel is Zimbabwe in 2017, where Beijing, its investments at stake, straddled the fence until Robert Mugabe fell off.</p>, <p>Guaidó’s big splash has caused widening ripples that relate only obliquely to Venezuelans’ suffering. Britain normally follows the sensible practice of recognising states, not particular governments. So the decision by <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt\">Jeremy Hunt</a>, the foreign secretary, to recognise Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, when he has neither control of the state nor an alternative government in place, looks rash.</p>, <p>Hunt’s decision can be explained by Brexit Britain’s pathetic hope to stay in Trump’s good books. Likewise the EU, which set up a novel mechanism last week to circumvent US sanctions on Iran, would rather support regime change at arm’s length in Venezuela than risk further provoking Trump closer to home. Europe, with its high-minded views on democracy and human rights, thus finds itself in bed with some low-life partners, such as Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro.</p>, <p>For the European left, including Britain’s Jeremy Corbyn, the “Bolivarian socialist revolution” led by Maduro’s predecessor, the late <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\">Hugo Chávez</a>, and its close ties to Castro-era Cuba, remains a totemic cause célèbre. The apparent attempt to overturn it by a Yanqui-picked, middle-class political neophyte has produced a viscerally negative reaction, with little thought for the revolution’s failings.</p>, <p>Likewise, Guaidó’s usurpation of Maduro “the usurper” has been hailed as a new dawn on the neoliberal, interventionist American right, buoyed last week by the return of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/26/elliott-abrams-venezuela-us-special-envoy\" title=\"\">Elliott Abrams</a>, a notorious 1980s cold warrior and self-described “counter-revolutionary”, as Trump’s Venezuela envoy. This meddling is further confusing a confused situation.</p>, <p>Yet all last week’s international manoeuvring and geopolitical jockeying have not changed the four basic alternatives facing Venezuelans, namely: stick with Maduro and hope things somehow improve; risk an indigenous military takeover of indefinite duration; negotiate an agreed, democratic transition leading to free elections, as advocated by Guaidó; or face possible civil war and foreign intervention.</p>, <p>The choice seems obvious, but that does not mean it will happen. One thing is certain. Any lasting solution, if and when it comes, will be local – as history shows. In 1913, Woodrow Wilson grandly declared: “I am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men.” Needless to say, he didn’t, nor was it his business to try. Yet more than a century later, the lesson must be re-learned: imposing solutions from outside does not work.</p>]'}\n",

His national security adviser, John Bolton, refused to exclude military action on Thursday, but said the immediate emphasis would be on economic measures.</p>, <p>“What we’re focusing on today is disconnecting the illegitimate Maduro regime from the source of its revenues,” Bolton told reporters. “We think consistent with our recognition of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a> as the constitutional interim president of Venezuela that those revenues should go to the legitimate government. It’s very complicated. We’re looking at a lot of different things we have to do, but that’s in the process.”</p>, <p>He said that Washington was currently trying to strengthen the coalition against Maduro among American and European states. The EU has called for new elections but most member states have not followed Washington in recognising Guaidó, the head of the opposition-led national assembly.</p>, <p>The UK however, broke European ranks on Thursday and sided with the US.</p>, <p>“This regime has done untold damage to the people of Venezuela, 10% of the population have left Venezuela such is the misery they are suffering,” the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said in a statement issued in Washington before a meeting with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and Vice-President Mike Pence.</p>, <p>“So the United Kingdom believes Juan Guaidó is the right person to take Venezuela forward. We are supporting the US, Canada, Brazil and Argentina to make that happen.”</p>, <p>The statement stopped just short of echoing US language on recognising Guaidó, however. “It is UK policy to recognise states, not governments,” a British official said.</p>, <p>The US initially ignored the Maduro government’s order expelling embassy staff, but late on Thursday the state department announced it was withdrawing “non-emergency US government employees”.</p>, <p>“We are prepared to do the things we need to do to make sure we keep our people safe,” a state department spokesperson said. “The full range of United States government resources are at the ready to ensure the safety and security of US diplomats and their families.”</p>, <p>The US has called for a UN security council emergency session on Saturday to discuss the crisis in Venezuela, although Russia opposes a debate on what Moscow says is an internal Venezuelan matter. </p>, <p>A Venezuelan monitoring group claimed at least a dozen people had been killed in the unrest. </p>, <p>In his speech, Padrino described <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/juan-guaido-venezuelan-opposition-leader-challenging-maduros-rule\">Juan Guaidó</a>’s decision to declare himself Venezuela’s president on Wednesday as a shameful and laughable fact but one that risked unleashing a wave of bloodshed. “I have to alert the people of Venezuela to the severe danger that this represents to our integrity and our national sovereignty.”</p>, <p>Facing “a criminal plan that flagrantly threatens the sovereignty and independence of the nation”, Padrino said the armed forces would remain loyal to Maduro. Dissent would not be tolerated, he added ominously.</p>, <p>“We will not tolerate acts of vandalism or terrorism by groups that promote violence as a perverse mechanism to achieve their objectives,” he said before ending his address with the rallying cry “<em>Chávez vive y la patria sigue!</em>” (“Chávez lives and the homeland goes on!”).</p>, <p>Analysts have long held that Maduro’s survival depends on the backing of the military, who he has rewarded with senior positions in government and the state oil company PDVSA.</p>, <p>But it is unclear how solid that support is. Guaidó and the opposition-held national assembly have sought to peel away the military, offering an amnesty to members of the armed forces who help bring about what they term a return to democracy. This week, authorities <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/21/venezuela-claims-foiled-attempted-military-uprising\">arrested 27 national guardsmen</a> who tried to launch an uprising against Maduro.</p>, <p>Venezuela expert Miguel Tinker Salas said he believed one of the key objectives of Guaidó and his international backers was to find and exploit “fissures within the military” in order to unseat Maduro.</p>, <p>“What they were hoping, I suspect, was lower-ranking officers to show discontent or to show a break with their superiors. I don’t see any evidence of that so far,” beyond <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/21/venezuela-claims-foiled-attempted-military-uprising\">a small uprising </a>in Caracas on Monday.</p>, <p>“So far the upper military class – the generals and the senior officers – have shown support for Maduro.”</p>, <p>Salas, the author of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/venezuela-what-everyone-needs-know\">Venezuela: What </a><a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/venezuela-what-everyone-needs-know\">Everyone </a><a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/venezuela-what-everyone-needs-know\">Needs to </a><a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/venezuela-what-everyone-needs-know\">Know,</a> said he was troubled by the potential for bloodshed in the days and weeks ahead.</p>, <p>“The risk is that this escalates into an open confrontation [between pro- and anti-Maduro groups] and then you have a foreign intervention,” he said.</p>, <p>“That is something that would be not only dangerous but catastrophic for Venezuela. And for Latin America it would be a return to the 1980s Reagan era of civil wars and conflicts that proved devastating to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and those countries of the region. We had hoped to be beyond that.”</p>]'}\n"

And now that I’m here, we’ve only had two clients.”</p>, <p><a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> has seen two previous attempts to unseat Maduro through mass street protests – both of which failed, prompting government crackdowns which left scores dead on both sides, and thousands jailed. So for many Caraqueños the latest unrest had an air of deja vu.</p>, <p>“I can’t keep grinding my life to a halt every time there is trouble – it’s endless here. And besides, you kind of know the drill,” said Cristina Fernández, a graphics designer, as she carried her shopping to her car .</p>, <p>“I didn’t take my kids to school, but other than that life must go on. It’s not like me stopping is going to bring down the government,” she said. “And I need to work because I need the money.”</p>, <p><a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-food/venezuelans-report-big-weight-losses-in-2017-as-hunger-hits-idUSKCN1G52HA\">Nearly 90% of Venezuelans live in poverty</a>, so it was perhaps understandable that for many, the daily struggle to get by should take priority over political theatre.</p>, <p>“My president is <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a> – not because the US says so, but because I want him: I want a change. The country can’t go on as it is,” said Caty Aguilar, 54, as she headed out from home in Petare. She works three jobs as a house cleaner, and sells phone cards and individual cigarettes – but even that is barely enough to get by.</p>, <p>Aguilar’s daughter is one of the 3 million Venezuelans who has fled the country, and occasionally sends remittances back home from Peru, but Aguilar also relies on the occasional box of subsidized food handed out by the government. She said a local official had warned her she would lose the subsidy if she attended anti-government protests, but she shrugged off the threat.</p>, <p>“I just don’t care any more. I don’t think the government has the money to keep buying them much longer anyway,” she said.</p>, <p>Across the country, Venezuelans turned to the strategies they have relied on in previous outbreaks of political drama.</p>, <p>“I’ve stocked up on food – although there is hardly anything to buy in the shops,” said Victoria Daboin, 26, from the Andean city of Mérida in the west. “This [unrest] is typical, it always happens in the country when there’s uncertainty.”</p>, <p>Fernández said that many Venezuelan families have come up with methods to get through periods of turmoil: “You stock up on food a couple of days when you see it coming. You keep kids home. You obsessively check Twitter and WhatsApp – but you no longer forward every post because most videos of burning cities or wounded people are fake or from Nicaragua,” she said.</p>, <p>But this week’s developments have added a new element of uncertainty to familiar rituals: since Guaidó took his oath of office, neither he nor Maduro have made any significant public appearance or official indication of their plans.</p>, <p>Internationally, supporters of the two men have lined up on familiar geopolitical lines: Russia, China, Cuba, Turkey and Nicaragua have backed Maduro; the US, the UK and most of Venezuela’s Latin American neighbours have backed Guaidó.</p>, <p>But how that support plays out on the ground remains unclear. When Donald Trump official recognized Guaidó as president, Maduro responded quickly by giving all US diplomatic staff 72 hours to leave the country.</p>, <p>However, Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said that US diplomats would remain in Venezuela because Maduro – who he described as an “ex-president” – lacks the legal authority to break off diplomatic relations”.</p>, <p>An email sent by the US embassy to its citizens in Venezuela emphasised they “are keeping regular hours” and on Thursday morning the street outside the embassy was quiet, with no sign that Venezuelan security forces were preparing to enforce Maduro’s deadline.</p>, <p><em>Additional reporting by Mariana Zúñiga</em></p>]'}\n",

The US response that time was to support Hernández against his rival Salvador Nasralla, who led a centre-left coalition.

In a statement the parliament urged the bloc’s 28 governments to follow suit and declare Guaidó “the only legitimate interim president” until there were “new free, transparent and credible presidential elections”.</p>, <p>The EU has imposed an arms embargo and sanctions on Venezuelan officials but UK foreign secretary <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jeremy-hunt\">Jeremy Hunt</a>, who arrived on Thursday for a two-day meeting of EU foreign ministers in Bucharest, wants the bloc to impose further targeted sanctions.</p>, <p>On Thursday, the Spanish news agency EFE said three of its journalists – a Spanish reporter, a Colombian photographer and a Colombian TV producer – who had been detained on Wednesday were being released and deported. Two detained French journalists working for television channel TMC were also released on Thursday.</p>, <p>“We firmly believe that all journalists should be able to exercise their duties and responsibilities and rights in the exercise of their work,” said Federica Mogherini, the EU foreign policy chief, in Bucharest.</p>, <p>Erika Guevara-Rosas, Amnesty International’s <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas\">Americas</a> director, said: “The detention of journalists is a flagrant and deeply concerning attack on freedom of expression and the right to truth … A free press is fundamental for the defence of human rights in any country in the world.”</p>, <p>Speaking on BBC radio, Hunt said a humanitarian catastrophe was unfolding in the country, with citizens struggling to find scraps of food. “We are not considering sanctions against the whole country because there is a humanitarian situation and we wouldn’t want to make the situation even worse,” he said. “But targeted sanctions against the kleptocrats who have enriched themselves on the back of the rest of the population who are very poor, that is something I think can be effective.”</p>, <p>Key EU countries are prepared to recognise Guaidó as the legitimate interim president of Venezuela if Maduro refuses to call fresh elections by Sunday. But not every EU state has issued the ultimatum, and Russia is looking to see if these divisions can be prised open. Moscow has so far offered full-throated support for Maduro.

How terribly scary!” Cabello added mockingly. “Is the US going to get involved in an attack against Venezuela?”</p>, <p>Maduro has accused Donald Trump and a “group of extremists around him” of plotting to topple him in order to seize Venezuela’s oil, and said he risked transforming the country into a new Vietnam.</p>, <p>Venezuela’s supreme court has imposed a <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/29/venezuela-juan-guaido-tarek-saab-investigation\">travel ban and financial restrictions</a> on Guaidó, including freezing his bank accounts.</p>, <p>Guaidó, 35, a former student leader and head of Venezuela’s opposition-run national assembly, has been at the forefront of a renewed attempt to force Maduro from power.</p>, <p>He said in an <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-talks-opposition.html\">opinion piece for the New York Times on Wednesday</a> that he had held “clandestine” meetings with the military to try to persuade them to withdraw their support for Maduro.

The Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, had been hardening his position since Thursday, when he called the opposition leader Juan Guaidó after he claimed to be the legitimate Venezuelan president. Sánchez held an impromptu summit with Latin American leaders at Davos to discuss the crisis.</p>, <p>The official EU statement, issued by its foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, did not go quite so far, calling for fresh elections and threatening “further actions, including on the issue of recognition of the country’s leadership” if Maduro did not comply. Her caution reflects doubts in Austria, Greece and Italy. Some of the doubters support Maduro. Others question a US strategy that could lead to further violence, and even support for a military coup. A joint statement can be vetoed by just one EU country.</p>, <p>By Saturday afternoon, the hawkish Pompeo, speaking at the special UN security council discussion on Venezuela, spelled out how little time the US had for fence-sitters.</p>, <p>“Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side,” he said. “No more delays, no more games. Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you’re in league with Maduro and his mayhem.”</p>, <p>Sir Alan Duncan, the British minister for Europe and <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/americas\">Americas</a>, was unambiguous when he flew to New York to give the British message personally at the UN: “Maduro is no longer the legitimate president of Venezuela,” he said as he endorsed the eight-day deadline.</p>, <p>Until Saturday, the UK had said Guaidó enjoyed widespread support. The caution was in part because as a matter of policy the UK recognises states, not governments. But efforts were under way to unite Europe and think through the consequences of delegitimising Maduro.</p>, <p>The eight-day pause also gives European diplomats time to bring doubters into line. Leading players, such as Spain, have no illusions that Maduro will call transparent elections, but believe the emphasis on elections shows Europe is backing democracy and not regime change.</p>, <p>British diplomats are determined to show how many chances at reconciliation Maduro has spurned. As long ago as May 2016, for instance, the Union of South American Nations tried to bring the two sides together with the help of the former presidents of the Dominican Republic, Panama and Spain.</p>, <p> Hunt’s support for Guaidó also has a domestic political dimension, because his team see Venezuela as a test case of how a Corbyn-led government would treat leftwing governments with dubious human rights records.</p>, <p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article was corrected on 28 January 2019.

In 2017, Russia agreed to restructure more than $3bn of Venezuelan debt and the Russian oil giant Rosneft has loaned a similar amount to PDVSA, the state-owned oil company. Rosneft also holds shares in Venezuelan oil production. </p>, <p>Another $3bn loan from Russia was used to buy weapons, including assault rifles, warplanes and helicopters, making Venezuela the largest operator of Russian military equipment in South America. Kalashnikov, the maker of the AK47, is building a factory in Venezuela, although its opening has been repeatedly delayed.</p>, <p>Estimates of how much Russia has invested in Venezuela vary. David Rozental, a researcher from the Institute of Latin America at the Russian Academy of Sciences, estimated the amount to be more than $20bn.</p>, <p>Vladimir Davydov, the academic director at the Institute of Latin America, said that Russia views Venezuela as its beachhead in Latin America and that the country’s large oil reserves made it a top priority for Russia. “What role will Russia play in the control of strategic resources? That is what is being decided in Venezuela,” Davydov said.</p>, <p>The man leading the charge has been Igor Sechin, the former military translator who now heads the Russian oil firm Rosneft. A fluent Spanish speaker, Sechin has met with Maduro regularly and has increased the Rosneft’s investment in Venezuelan oil production and its state-owned producer.</p>, <p>“[Sechin] knows Latin America quite well, he is very influential,” said Davydov. “He wants to maintain Rosneft’s position in Venezuela and there are different ways to do that.”</p>, <p>For now, Davydov and his colleagues said they did not expect Russia to involve itself militarily in the Venezuelan crisis, even in the event of American-backed intervention.</p>, <p>It would primarily seek a role as an intermediary, they said, as a means to project Russian power and to protect its investment.</p>, <p>Even in the case of a transfer of power, Russia may not stand to lose everything. “We didn’t conclude deals with [Hugo] Chávez or Maduro, we concluded deals with the parliament of Venezuela,” said Rozental, during a radio broadcast on Vesti FM this week. “In this sense, I don’t think that there’s a serious threat to Russian assets.”</p>]'}\n",

We will allow our constitution to be violated … ? No!” said Maduro, blaming what he branded an attempted coup on Donald Trump’s “madness”.</p>, <p>Venezuela’s military top brass also threw their support behind Maduro with defence minister, Vladimir Padrino, warning the country could be plunged into a devastating conflict by Guaidó’s “laughable” but dangerous gambit. “It is not civil war, a war between brothers, that will solve the problems of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a>. It is dialogue,” Padrino said.</p>, <p>Venezuela expert Miguel Tinker Salas said he believed a negotiated solution – such as the one being promoted by the governments of Mexico and Uruguay – was the only way to defuse an increasingly perilous standoff that had the potential to escalate into a major geopolitical crisis between the US, Russia and China.</p>, <p>But Salas said widespread guarantees would have to be given to Maduro’s backers. “It’s not just about Maduro going into exile. What happens to all the <em>chavistas</em>?” We’re not talking about merely a couple of hundred people. We are talking about hundreds of thousands who have supported Chávez – and they are worried about retribution.”</p>, <p>In his interview, Guaidó insisted “nobody wanted” a foreign military intervention in Venezuela to remove Maduro and said he hoped a peaceful exit path could be found.</p>, <p>“We must not lose hope,” he said, urging supporters to continue taking to the streets to demand change.</p>]'}\n",

You can’t simply wish away dictatorships such as Venezuela and Cuba.”</p>, <p>Bolsonaro’s politician son, Eduardo, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/BolsonaroSP/status/1082468358845546497\">tweeted</a>: “The noose is tightening around Nicolás Maduro.”</p>, <p>David Smilde, a Venezuela expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group, said there was a growing sense that with the end of Maduro’s first term and growing regional pressure the crisis was entering a new phase: “But nobody really knows just exactly what it amounts to.</p>, <p>“It’s one thing to say: ‘You’re illegitimate’. But how much does that mean in the end? It doesn’t look like any of the Lima Group members or the United States are going to close up their embassies or break off diplomatic relations,” he said.</p>, <p>“They want Venezuela to return to democracy in some way … [and to stop] <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/venezuela-brazil-hunger-highway\">the mass exodus of Venezuelans</a> … but I don’t think they really have much of an idea how to do that.”</p>, <p>Maduro and his inner circle would be fretting over their increasing isolation “and that’s why you see them reaching out to the Russians and the Chinese continually”, Smilde said. But any international effort to engineer a peaceful transition would founder unless Venezuela’s fractured opposition united.</p>, <p>“Until that happens, the government can kind of do whatever it wants – even a weak government can consolidate if it has no opposition.”</p>]'}\n",

The people are fed up.

Although thousands cross the nearby Simón Bolívar bridge on foot every day, the border has been closed to most vehicles since 2015 following a string of disputes between the two countries.</p>, <p>In advance of the first shipment of aid to the border, Maduro had the Tienditas bridge blockaded with containers and an oil tank. The bridge had long been lightly barricaded with a wire fence, aimed at keeping out contraband smugglers.</p>, <p>While in part a bid to get much-needed food and medicine to Venezuela’s suffering population, Saturday’s aid mission is also, Guaidó and the Trump administration have said, intended to weaken Maduro by forcing the military to disobey their boss and allow the aid on to Venezuelan soil, which could play into Maduro’s narrative that the US is seeking to invade.</p>, <p>“You will find no safe harbour, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything,” Donald Trump said in a speech in at <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida\">Florida</a> International University in Miami on Monday before large American and Venezuelan flags. “We seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open.”</p>, <p>Many humanitarian groups have distanced themselves from the aid operation, given its overtly political nature. “Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or any other objectives,” UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric told reporters in New York last week.</p>, <p>The move comes against the backdrop of a propaganda war between Guaidó and Maduro, with <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/19/maduro-government-richard-branson-rival-venezuela-concerts\">rival concerts</a> set up in support of each president’s stance over the aid.</p>, <p>Richard Branson, the billionaire founder of the Virgin Group, threw his clout and cash behind Guaidó’s efforts earlier this month when he announced a concert in Cúcuta to raise funds to relieve Venezuela’s humanitarian crisis, and to pressure Maduro to open up his country’s borders. That concert, which will take place on Friday, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of attendees.</p>, <p>“Venezuela sadly has not become the utopia that the current administration of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> or the past administration were hoping for, and that has resulted in a lot of people literally dying from lack of medical help,” Branson told the Associated Press in a telephone interview from Necker, his private island in the British Virgin Islands, on Monday. “I think it will draw attention to the problem on a global basis.”</p>, <p>Maduro’s rival concert will take place on Saturday and Sunday, over the border from the one in <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/colombia\">Colombia</a> organised by Branson, Venezuela’s information minister Jorge Rodríguez announced on Monday. In an apparent retort to the US aid project, Rodríguez announced that 20,000 boxes of food aid would be sent to Cúcuta.</p>, <p>Guaidó lambasted the move by Maduro’s government to put on a rival concert, calling it “desperate”.</p>, <p>“They’re debating whether the aid should come in or not ... They don’t know what to do,” Guaidó said on Monday. “They’re now making up a concert. How many concerts are they going to stage?”</p>, <p>Since 2015, some three million Venezuelans have fled spiralling hyperinflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine, with almost 1.5 million staying in Colombia, according to UNHCR.

Most come to briefly work or shop for goods unavailable or prohibitively expensive in <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a>, others for hospital visits. But for about 5,000 a day,<strong> </strong>the Simón Bolívar bridge that divides the two countries is the last they will see of their homeland for the foreseeable future.</p>, <p>Siblings Antonio and Gabriela Yany have fled Maracay in northern Venezuela, and are heading to Bogotá to join their parents who left last year. “We have nothing to eat, we go hungry for days and our salaries buy us nothing,” Antonio said, as he waited outside a bus terminal in Cúcuta, a city on Colombia’s eastern border with Venezuela. “Things aren’t changing anytime soon there.”</p>, <p>Oil-rich Venezuela is mired in economic and political turmoil, with severe shortages of staple foods and basic medicines. Hyperinflation has rendered the currency practically worthless, and crime is widespread. The dire situation has triggered an exodus of Venezuelans, arguably the largest mass migration in Latin America’s history. More than 3 million <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/08/venezuela-migrants-fleeing-exodus-increase-united-nations\">have now fled</a>, with more than a million in <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/08/venezuela-migrants-colombia-brazil-borders\">Colombia</a>. The UNHCR has projected that 2 million more people could leave Venezuela this year.</p>, <p>Meanwhile, there is uncertainty around who leads the country. President Nicolás Maduro sits in the presidential palace but his leadership is no longer recognised by the United States, Canada and a dozen Latin American countries. They favour Juan Guaidó, the young leader of the opposition-held congress <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/27/venezuela-opposition-leader-says-he-has-met-maduro-government-officials\">who last Wednesday declared himself interim president </a>until free and fair elections are held.</p>, <p>“Maduro is a dictator and a clown, he laughs away while his people are starving,” said Alfonso Castro, who fled Venezuela last year. He now lives in Cúcuta and helps other migrants cart their luggage across the bridge for coins. “Guaidó is a blessing. If he takes power I’ll go home to my family tomorrow.”</p>, <p>When Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that “all options are on the table” should Maduro not cede power, implying the possibility of US military intervention, Castro was joyous. “I pray overnight that Uncle Sam’s soldiers come,” he said, grinning widely.</p>, <p>However, discussions of who will emerge victorious in the battle for the presidency remain largely academic for many Venezuelans struggling to get by in Colombia. “There may be discussions about new leaders but all of that is going on in Caracas,” said Felipe Muñoz, the Colombian government’s border tsar who was in Cúcuta to cut the ribbon on a new health centre set up by international NGOs. “You ask anyone here, they’ll tell you that all they care about is feeding their families.”</p>, <p>It is that desperation that led Keymar Luna make the journey to Cúcuta, where she is waiting to catch a bus to the nearby town Málaga, where her husband moved last year. “It’s no secret how difficult life is there,” the young woman said. “It’s horrible to have to leave your own country, and to leave your family. Nobody wants that.”</p>, <p>Analysts see no end in sight to the misery, despite the possibility of regime change in Caracas.</p>, <p>“I see it getting worse before it gets better,” said Trisha Brury, the International Rescue Committee’s deputy director for Colombia. “The only good thing to come out of the chaos in Caracas is that more attention is being brought to this humanitarian crisis.”</p>, <p>It is not only Colombia receiving refugees and migrants, with Brazil – which borders Venezuela to the south – another destination for those fleeing the crisis.</p>, <p>Migrants who have fled to the troubled Brazilian border town of Pacaraima express fear, cynicism, confusion and cautious optimism over the possibility their country’s spiralling crisis could lead to change. But there was no consensus that Guaído’s move to declare himself president would work unless the Venezuelan army did not back him.</p>, <p>Yasmira Veliz, 50, a former teacher from Caracas now helping at a Catholic church to serve breakfasts to 700 migrants every morning, said Guaído’s self-declaration was unconstitutional. “You can’t nominate yourself president,” she said. “You know what the solution is? To kill Maduro. This is the way out.”</p>, <p>Also helping serve the rudimentary breakfast of coffee with milk, bread and fruit to hundreds of migrants early on Friday morning was Delia Párica, 41, a former nurse. She agreed with Veliz: “Maduro will not deliver up power. He prefers to die,” she said. “If the US goes to war against Venezuela Russia will support it [the regime].”</p>, <p>Both women welcomed the confrontational stance of the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, towards Maduro. “We feel safe in Brazil,” said Párica.</p>, <p>Others sought to find humour in the humanitarian crisis. “Venezuela has two presidents and two assemblies!” joked Helinger Cordova, 25, a shop-worker from Maturín who has been in Brazil for a year. “There will be a change. We don’t know if it will be for the better.”</p>, <p>So far there has not been a spike in the numbers of migrants crossing the border.

Chávez had led an abortive coup attempt in 1992 and after winning power through the ballot box he set about transforming society. Chávez drove through a wide range of social reforms as part of his Bolivarian revolution, financed with the help of high oil profits – but he also bypassed parliament with a new constitution in 1999.</p>, <p>The muzzling of parliamentary democracy – and the spread of corruption and mismanagement in state-run enterprises – intensified after 2010 amid falling oil prices. Chávez’s “economic war” against shortages led to hyperinflation and the collapse of private sector industry.

The earliest it will reach the border is Thursday morning.<br/></p>, <p>Maduro has repeatedly denied his economically devastated country is facing a humanitarian crisis, apparently fearing such an acceptance could be used to justify foreign military intervention. “We are not beggars,” he said in a speech to troops this week.</p>, <p>The attempt by his political rival, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a>, to push aid in through Venezuela’s borders with Colombia and Brazil represents the latest attempt to weaken Maduro’s embattled regime by forcing members of the military to disobey his orders and allow the aid to pass.</p>, <p>“The main goal now is to look to break the military – and the humanitarian aid is basically the Trojan horse to try to do that,” said Maryhen Jiménez Morales, an Oxford University specialist in Venezuelan politics.</p>, <p>Guaidó urged Venezuela’s border troops not to stand in the way of humanitarian aid that was intended to help “your family, your sister, your mum, your wife – who surely need these supplies”.</p>, <p>Juan Andrés Mejía, a lawmaker from Guaidó’s party, Voluntad Popular (People’s Will), told the Guardian that trying to deliver aid across Venezuela’s borders was a double challenge to Maduro’s regime – as well as an effort to alleviate a humanitarian crisis that has seen <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/08/venezuela-migrants-fleeing-exodus-increase-united-nations\">millions of Venezuelans flee abroad</a>.</p>, <p>“The government has a dilemma … Either they let it in [and look weak] or they refuse it, which I don’t think they will because they are not so stupid, and they will also lose. So it is a win-win situation for us – and for the people.”</p>, <p>Mejía denied that the opposition hoped to provoke a military incident which some fear could be used to justify international intervention to unseat Maduro. “That’s not our goal. That is not what we are looking for. Basically, the strategy … is to show people that humanitarian aid is real, [that] it is not only a discourse … and it is close and it can be here soon.”</p>, <p>Mejía added: “We are a non-violent movement. We do not have weapons and we do not want to have them. We are absolutely certain that violence benefits the government and we cannot win a violent struggle against the government.”</p>, <p>The United Nations warned against using aid as a political tool. “Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives,” said a spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric. “When we see the present standoff it becomes even more clear that serious political negotiations between the parties are necessary to find a solution leading to lasting peace for the people of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a>.”</p>, <p>A congressman from Cúcuta, Juan Capacho, told the Guardian the blockade was a “tyrannical irresponsibility that we will get over”, and that the aid would “help give Venezuela liberty”.</p>, <p>Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, tweeted: “The Venezuelan people desperately need humanitarian aid. The U.S. &amp; other countries are trying to help, but <del>#</del>Venezuela’s military under Maduro’s orders is blocking aid with trucks and shipping tankers. The Maduro regime must LET THE AID REACH THE STARVING PEOPLE.”</p>, <p>However, Maduro and members of his inner circle have remained publicly adamant that the aid will not be allowed in.</p>, <p>“With this show of humanitarian aid they are trying to send a message: ‘Venezuela has to go begging to the world!’ And <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> will not beg for anything from anyone in this world,” Maduro said on Monday.</p>, <p>On Tuesday, Diosdado Cabello, another top Chavista, depicted the aid effort as part of a hostile foreign military intervention that would be rebuffed.</p>, <p>“Our territory must be respected.

Chávez had led an abortive coup attempt in 1992 and after winning power through the ballot box he set about transforming society.

How many more will die if we carry on like this?”</p>, <p>Pisani, an unemployed 45-year-old, is still waiting for an official explanation about who shot her nephew and why. His death certificate states he died from a firearm injury but offers no hint of the weapon used – or the motive.</p>, <p>But she believes his killers were from Faes, a shadowy and fearsome special forces unit activists suspect Maduro has tasked with pacifying the city’s impoverished redbrick <em>barrios</em> in a bid to snuff out protest in areas once considered the cradle of Chavismo.</p>, <p>“The poor areas are where most people live – and since we don’t support them any more I guess they want to kill us all,” said Pisani, who says witnesses told her Faes agents arrived at the protest shortly before her nephew was shot in the arm and chest.</p>, <p><a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\">Hugo Chávez</a> first took office in January 1999 – just a few months before Alixon Pisani was born – vowing to blaze a Boilvarian trail for Venezuela’s long-forgotten poor<em>.</em></p>, <p>In his first post-election speech, the <em>comandante</em> promised he would not rest while there were still children in the streets and families going hungry. “Today a new battle starts for the salvation of <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a>,” Chávez said.</p>, <p>In the early years of Chavismo, its leader won global accolades and a cult following for his crusade to help Venezuela’s poor. Social projects known as <em>misiones</em> brought healthcare and education to millions of disenfranchised citizens.</p>, <p>“[Chávez] showed us there is a different and a better way of doing things: it’s called socialism, it’s called social justice,” Labour leader Jeremy<em> </em>Corbyn <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FbWsINjpRY\">said</a> in 2013.</p>, <p>But two decades after Chávez’s rise to power, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/on-the-road-venezuela-20-years-after-hugo-chavez-rise\">Venezuela is on its knees</a>, and many who were once loyalists have lost faith in his successor. And, increasingly, they are taking to the streets to demand change.</p>, <p>“We’ve never had protests here in Catia – this is new,” said Pisani, attributing the shift to the country’s economic and social collapse under Chávez’s heir.</p>, <p>“Before, I’d open my fridge and see ham, cheese, eggs, meat, chicken. These days there’s nothing but water – and sometimes we don’t even have that. It’s insanity – we never thought we’d be living like this,” she said.</p>, <p>The day he died, Alixon Pisani – who worked in a local bakery – had gone out to protest the “beggary” into which their oil-rich nation has been plunged. “It’s as if there is no government in this country,” Pisani complained. “How can you <em>not</em> go out to protest?”</p>, <p>Across town, in a sprawling eastern neighbourhood called José Félix Ribas, Venezuela’s special forces have also made their deadly presence felt in an apparent bid to crush dissent.</p>, <p>“It’s the first time they’ve attacked with so much force,” said one local woman, too scared to be named, as she and other residents described <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-police/inside-a-raid-in-maduros-crackdown-on-critics-in-venezuela-slums-idUSKCN1PS07M\">a series of war-like operations</a> in the days after opposition leader <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a> sparked the current political crisis by declaring himself Venezuela’s rightful president on 23 January.</p>, <p>A second woman recalled balaclava-wearing, rifle-toting troops swarming into the labyrinthine community like an army of “little black ants”, kicking down doors and shooting.</p>, <p>“We heard the bangs: tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka-tacka. It was horrible,” said the woman, whose home was stormed.</p>, <p>“They want to silence the <em>barrios</em> because we are the most affected [by the crisis],” she added. “They want to silence the <em>barrios – </em>but it’s impossible because people have had enough.”</p>, <p>“Even the Chavistas around here don’t agree with <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro\">Nicolás Maduro</a>,” said her 18-year-old son, who described narrowly escaping death during one operation, sprinting over rooftops and down alleys as the agents opened fire.</p>, <p>The teenager, who now sleeps in another part of Caracas for fear of being killed, agreed the repression was designed to dissuade the urban poor from leaving their hilltop homes to join the revolt. “If the <em>barrio</em> goes down it will be like a nuclear bomb.”</p>, <p>Things were not always thus, a group of locals explained as they sat around a wooden table in a kitchen equipped with nothing but a broken stove and an almost bare pantry.</p>, <p>“Chávez would go into the <em>barrios</em>, into any house, and whichever house Chávez went into they’d say: ‘Have a little cup of coffee, my <em>presidente,</em>’” said the 18-year-old. “They adored him. They loved him.”</p>, <p>And what if Maduro came calling today?</p>, <p>“I’d hit him with a chair,” he replied.</p>, <p>“We’d keep him here for a week eating what we have to eat – lentils and beans – to see if he liked it,” his mother chuckled sarcastically.</p>, <p>“Without any salt,” chipped in a third woman.</p>, <p>Faes – the special action force – has earned notoriety since the uprising against Maduro began last month. Graffiti artists have daubed Caracas’ walls with messages denouncing its operatives as “murderers of the people”.</p>, <p>But little is known about the elite group’s inner workings or even who exactly commands it.

By last year it boasted almost 1,300 agents.</p>, <p>In a recent post on <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/faespnb/?hl=es\">its Instagram account</a> the group said its role was to “guarantee security, tranquility and peace” for all Venezuelans.</p>, <p>But activists say it has taken on an explicitly political role since the most severe challenge to Maduro’s rule erupted last month.</p>, <p>In <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bs8okIVhfAT/\">one Instagram video</a>, a Faes commander urges troops to show “absolute loyalty to Maduro” given the “extremely difficult moments” his administration was facing. “As soldiers who are faithful to the revolution, let’s go for it, let’s really go for it – without hesitation,” he says.</p>, <p>Provea’s coordinator, Rafael Uzcátegui, said: “What the government is trying to do is contain the discontent, to contain the anger – not by addressing the citizens’ concerns but by instilling terror and fear.”</p>, <p>Uzcátegui said his group had counted 43 killings linked to the protests. It had not been possible to identify the perpetrators of each death but he believed Faes was the number one culprit, followed by the pro-government paramilitary groups known as <em>colectivos</em>. Faes’ role appeared to be “neutralizing the greatest possible number of people”, not bringing criminals to justice.</p>, <p>Asked about alleged Faes killings on Venezuelan television last week, the attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said the criminal responsibility for such acts was “individual. Those who commit violations ... will be prosecuted, whichever part of the police they are from.”</p>, <p>On Monday, as she prepared for the last of nine evenings of mourning, Pisani said she felt uneasy about the prospect of foreign military intervention to unseat Maduro, but was adamant he had to step down.</p>, <p>“I want him to go. He must realize this country is a disaster,” she said.</p>, <p>Most of all, though, she wanted answers about the masked gunmen who had condemned her nephew to an unmarked concrete grave.</p>, <p>“Why did they kill him? What for?” she asked. “His life had hardly even begun.”</p>]'}\n",

Borrowing one of the <em>comandante</em>’s famous expressions to describe Venezuela’s disintegration, Mejías added: “You don’t need glasses to see what’s right before your eyes.”</p>, <p>As Venezuelans confronted the latest political upheaval to engulf their nation last week, there was widespread consensus on the capital’s streets that change was urgently needed – and possibly on the horizon.</p>, <p>“We must have change. We’re tired of seeing children eating in the rubbish,” said Luis Torres, 34, an unemployed father-of-two from Petare, a sprawling shanty in the city’s east.</p>, <p>But as your correspondent moved around Caracas on Friday, unease and frustration could be seen, and deep trepidation over what is now a profoundly uncertain future.</p>, <p>“I want a change – but not through a coup or an intervention,” said Naikary Agresot, 17, a student from Gramoven, a working-class and heavily pro-Chávez community in west Caracas. “I wish Maduro could understand that things have gotten out of control and make room for someone who truly can change the country,” added Agresot, who said she often lacked the money to take the bus to school or buy food.</p>, <p>“I think he’s had his chance and he didn’t know how to take advantage of it,” she said of Maduro, who was first elected after Chávez died in 2013 and re-elected <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/20/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-election\" title=\"\">last May in elections widely denounced as a farce</a>. “It isn’t fair that someone works for a whole month and has to spend half their salary on a kilo of rice or meat.”</p>, <p>Torres was among those who took to the streets last week to support Guaidó and said there were thousands of other slum-dwellers who also wanted Maduro gone. “Here the prices are like in Switzerland, but you earn like you’re in Haiti,” he said.</p>, <p>However, while he was desperate for “freedom” Torres was alarmed at the prospect of a foreign military intervention to oust Maduro and hoped a peaceful way out could be found. The US has warned that “all options are on the table” if Maduro responds to Guaidó’s challenge with violence, while Maduro ordered his troops to prepare to defeat “any imperialist enemy who dares touch our soil”.</p>, <p>“If there’s no food now, just imagine what it would be like in a war … we’ve seen what happened in Syria and Libya and we do not want this,” Torres said.</p>, <p>Opposition to Maduro – who claims Guaidó’s move is part of a US-sponsored “coup” similar to the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/apr/21/usa.venezuela\" title=\"\">botched 2002 attempt to topple his mentor </a>– was everywhere. But there was support, too. “I want to give him another chance,” said Yenny Cumana, a 32-year-old housewife from 24 de Julio, a community in Petare that was rocked by protests last week.</p>, <p>“I want to believe and I want things to improve so the country goes back to being like it was.”</p>, <p>Addressing a sea of supporters in Plaza Bolívar de Chacao on Friday, Guaidó rejected claims that he was involved in a coup and said his movement had identified “a clear path” out of Venezuela’s current nightmare: Maduro’s exit, the installation of a transitional government, and free and fair elections. On Saturday the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/26/european-leaders-ready-to-recognise-guaido-as-venezuelan-president\" title=\"\">leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Spain</a> gave Maduro an eight-day ultimatum to call a vote or they would back his challenger.</p>, <p>But with Maduro refusing to budge and China and Russia backing his administration, Venezuela’s fate is shrouded in uncertainty. Many see the potential for violence, civil war or even a catastrophic cold war-style clash between the US, China and Russia if a peaceful resolution is not found. “I don’t think anyone can predict what is going to happen,” said Moisés Naím, a Venezuelan scholar who was the country’s trade minister during the 1990s.</p>, <p>Naím, a vocal critic of Chavismo, said he was encouraged by recent developments, calling them the opposition’s first bit of good news since Chávez launched his ill-fated Bolivarian revolution two decades ago. “There are reasons to celebrate. The opposition has done a wonderful job of acting in a coherent and coordinated way. The international community … has rallied in very significant ways. [Last week’s] marches and demonstrations included everyone. It was no longer just the [wealthy] east of Caracas protesting. It was the barrios. Everyone was in the streets showing opposition to Maduro.”</p>, <p>But Naím was also troubled by the potential for bloodshed if different military factions started backing different leaders. “I am worried about a country that can fragment under different chieftains and warlords and generals and narco-traffickers [and guerrilla groups] and … <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> becoming like a tapestry of different power centres.” So great are the uncertainties it is unclear even where Guaidó might seek to set up his parallel government if Maduro – who also has the backing of Venezuela’s military top brass – hangs on. Naím said he could imagine a situation where Caracas was politically partitioned, with Maduro in the Miraflores presidential palace and Guaidó having his headquarters in the leafy eastern district of Altamira. “It could be as granular as that,” he said.</p>, <p>“Venezuela could evolve towards a Lebanon circa 1985 … [when] after the war it fragmented and each neighbourhood had its own militia with its own head and you needed permits to move across the neighbourhoods.”</p>, <p>Mejías, who had never attended a political rally before Friday’s, said he hoped Venezuela’s military would step in to broker a solution that would avoid a “gringo” intervention and a bloodbath. “If we are here and there’s an invasion, they’ll fill everyone with lead, whether you’re a Chavista or from the opposition.”</p>, <p>As Venezuela lurches towards a new, unsettled future, Mejías hoped that better times were coming “and we can go back to being what we were before”.</p>, <p>“We can’t be pessimistic,” he insisted as the crowds poured into the square to hear from a man some hope will prove Venezuela’s saviour. “We must have faith.”</p>]'}\n",

They aimed to reach the Miraflores presidential palace and force embattled President Nicolás Maduro out of office.</p>, <p>People took to the streets in support, and violent clashes with police carried on for days, but their attempt ultimately failed. Two dozen plotters were swiftly arrested, and countless others have not been seen since that night. Maduro had sent a clear warning to other would-be dissidents: he may be weakened but for now he still commanded the levers of power in Caracas.</p>, <p>“The normal soldiers, people like me, suffer the same as everyone else,” says Solano. “It is fear that keeps lower ranks [of the military] in line. Fear created by the knowledge that if you speak out publicly, they will torture and kill you and your family.”</p>, <p>Cúcuta, the Colombian border city where he is hiding out, has become infiltrated with spies, Solano says, accusing a man who hails him as a friend as one of them. Military defectors are of particular interest to both sides in the power struggle currently setting <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela\">Venezuela</a> on edge.</p>, <p>Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader and self-declared interim president, commands the backing of the US and dozens of other countries, but he has not been able to persuade the military to defect in numbers significant enough to shift the balance of power.</p>, <p>Maduro and his late predecessor, Hugo Chávez, won their senior officers’ loyalty by rewarding them lavishly for their service, promoting over a thousand to the rank of general, handing out lucrative positions at PDVSA, the state oil company, and allegedly turning a blind eye to involvement in drug trafficking, illegal mining and extortion.</p>, <p>Guaidó and his his allies are trying to whittle away at this support with Saturday’s planned controversial delivery of humanitarian aid sent by the US. They are also trying to sideline those generals by tapping into discontent among rank and file soldiers.</p>, <p>He aims to force these soldiers’ hand by offering them a hard choice: follow their orders and deny fellow Venezuelans much-needed food and medicines, or disobey Maduro publicly. But Solano knows first-hand what it means to go up against Maduro.</p>, <p>Solano alleges that his niece was raped and tortured by DCGIM, a military intelligence wing, when it became aware of his involvement in last month’s uprising.</p>, <p>He had already begun the complicated journey to Colombia, but his house was ransacked, and other members of his family were detained. A side business, a small shop below his Caracas home, was sacked.</p>, <p>“They [the authorities] are a mafia who control people only with violence,” Solano said. “They already know the people in their hearts are with Guaidó so they have to resort to barbarism.”</p>, <p>A slew of defections have already taken place, but mostly among officers safely beyond Maduro’s reach. His defence attache to the embassy in Washington announced his support for Guaidó last month, and a handful of other generals have switched sides. On Thursday, a former spy chief also threw his weight behind the young opposition leader.</p>, <p>The mass military exodus so many were hoping for has yet to materialise however, and not for a lack of trying. In late January, Guaidó canvassed military bases across the country, promising soldiers in a letter distributed to officers that they would be given amnesty if they “contribute to the reestablishment of democratic order”.</p>, <p>It is an effort bolstered by international pressure, with the Trump administration – Guaidó’s most prominent backer – calling on the military to allow aid into the country and side with their man.</p>, <p>“You will find no safe harbour, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything,” Donald Trump said in a speech at Florida International University in Miami on Monday before large US and Venezuelan flags. “We seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open,” he added, reviving fears that a military intervention could be on the cards.</p>, <p>Raúl Daniel Alvarenga was a sergeant major in the Venezuelan army, serving from 1997 until 2013, when he resigned in protest and fled the country.</p>, <p>“My escape to Colombia was like a movie,” he says, detailing a journey that involved dodging the police and sleeping in homeless shelters. “It’s naive to think people will just switch sides in the face of such intimidation.”</p>, <p>Six years later, Alvarenga says he still lives on edge, keeping his intelligence and special operative skills honed. “I’m always ready,” he says. “Lamentably, in Venezuela if they catch you, they will torture you physically and psychologically.”</p>]'}\n",

It’s awful. But I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, ‘What the fuck are you doing?’” The recounting is given in an interview with the Independent as Neeson promotes his new film Cold Pursuit. Neeson said growing up in Northern Ireland during the Troubles had also affected his sense of permissible violence. “I knew a couple of guys that died on hunger strike … I understand that need for revenge, but it just leads to more revenge, to more killing and more killing … But that primal need, I understand.”</p>, <p><strong>Chips are down – </strong>Can’t blame Brexit for this one.

Yields of carrots and onions were also sharply down. Cedric Porter, editor of World Potato Markets (subscribe today!), said chips were 3cm shorter on average in the UK: “Smaller potatoes means smaller chips.” The summer of 2018 was the joint hottest on record, with some places not seeing any rain for 58 days. The lack of water resulted in the fourth lowest potato harvest in the last 60 years. In its report Recipe for Disaster, the Climate Coalition warns that three-quarters of Britain’s potato-growing land could be unusable 2050. The report calls for urgent reductions of carbon emissions and food waste by, for example, eating more wonky veg.</p>, <p>“Poking up above the Manhattan skyline like etiolated beanpoles, they seem to defy the laws of both gravity and commercial sense.

The<strong> Independent</strong>, which secured the Neeson interview, carries a mournful image of him rather than the macho options used elsewhere. Its splash is the admission that ministers quietly offered Nissan millions to keep making cars in a post-Brexit UK. The<strong> Guardian</strong> focuses on business secretary Greg Clark’s previous denials of any “special deal”: “Minister under fire as secret £80m Nissan deal revealed”. The main image is the underwater wreck of Emiliano Sala’s plane, with a third story on social media driving anxiety among the young.</p>, <p>The<strong> Telegraph</strong> goes with Clark and Nissan, and the <strong>FT</strong> follows a similar vein but tops it with Theresa May facing pressure to rule out no deal.

I’m very pleased to represent my people.”</p>, <p>Verhofstadt’s remarks provoked a sharp rebuke from Salvini, leader of the far-right League.</p>, <p>“That some European bureaucrats, accomplices to the disaster of these years, dare to insult the Italian premier, government and people is really disgraceful,” he wrote on Twitter.</p>, <p>Conte also came under fire from other European politicians, including Udo Bullman, leader of the European Socialists and Democrats grouping, who said he was “saddened by the senseless escalation between Italy and France”.</p>, <p>Conte confirmed on Wednesday that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, had spoken to the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, by phone, the first official contact between the two countries since France recalled its ambassador on Thursday. Conte insisted relations were “solid” and could not be blighted by “single episodes”.</p>, <p>Touching on other contentious issues, the MEP Manfred Weber asked Conte why Italy was not supporting “democratic forces in Venezuela” and why the coalition partners had failed to agree on whether to continue work on a long-contested high-speed rail project linking the northern Italian city of Turin with Lyon in France. Salvini’s League supports the project, while Di Maio’s Five Star Movement (M5S) is vehemently opposed.</p>, <p>In what is likely to further harm relations with Paris, a cost-benefit analysis commissioned by the transport ministry, led by an M5S politician, has concluded that the project is a waste of public money and would deliver a negative economic return of €7bn-€8bn.</p>, <p>The €20bn bill is being shared between Italy, France and the EU, which late last year said it was prepared to increase its contribution to 50% of the overall cost.</p>, <p>The French committee for the project, Comité Transalpine Lyon-Turin, criticised the analysis as “extraordinarily biased”. In November, the French transport ministry said Italy must decide by early 2019.

As Simon Hattenstone writes, the Indian-born star’s newest film, Love Sonia, about a desperate sex worker in a brutal tale of trafficking <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/27/freida-pinto-i-wouldnt-work-with-woody-allen-again\">is everything viewers have come not to expect</a>: a complex, edgy and selfish character caught in a brutal world. Pinto first saw the script a decade ago. But in hindsight, she says, she wasn’t ready for Love Sonia. She was too unworldly. “I thought it was exaggerated when I read the script. I couldn’t believe what I was reading.” Later, when she met trafficked sex workers advising on the film, she began to think that, if anything, the story had been understated.</p>, <p>Off-screen, Pinto has been a force for good, consistently campaigning for the rights of women. Does she see a contradiction between her feminism and the films she has made? “Completely! There was no way I agreed with so much that I did in my early career.” As for now, Pinto could not be happier that nobody is likely to come out of Love Sonia discussing her looks. On its release in India, the film was not been warmly received. “People haven’t welcomed a film that exposes the underbelly of the country. It hasn’t done well.” But she says she is not going to judge the film’s success by its box office takings – highlighting the trafficking scandal is far more important.</p>, <p><a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/mauricio-pochettino\">Mauricio Pochettino</a> has defended his record at Tottenham and argued claiming silverware <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-focus-top-four-not-cups\">would serve only to “build egos”</a> rather than maintain progress after seeing his team <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/27/crystal-palace-tottenham-fa-cup-match-report\">knocked out of a second domestic cup competition in four days</a>.</p>, <p>Novak Djokovic is the best men’s tennis player in the world: now, and for the foreseeable future, perhaps until he chooses to retire, which looks to be a few years away yet, <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jan/27/novak-djokovic-rafael-nadal-australian-open-final\">he hinted after the Australian Open final</a>.

For two European powers to fall out to this extent shows how far Italy’s government of the far-right League and anti-establishment populist Five Star Movement (M5S) is prepared to break the rules.</p>, <p>Only a fortnight ago, faced by persistent insults from Rome, the Elysée chose to take the high road, saying it would not enter a stupidity contest. President <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron\">Emmanuel Macron</a> had also promised not answer back, saying that is what the Italians wanted.</p>, <p>But faced by Italian deputy prime minister Luigi Di Maio’s repeated courting of leaders of the <em>gilet jaunes</em> (yellow vests) protests that have repeatedly sparked violence in Paris, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/06/italys-deputy-pm-luigi-di-maio-meets-senior-gilets-jaunes-figure\">French patience snapped</a>.</p>, <p>It marks an extraordinary collapse in Franco-Italian relations since the recent high water mark of January 2018 when Macron signed a bilateral treaty of friendship alongside Italy’s previous prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni. That was only two months before the Italian elections in May.</p>, <p>Macron had signed the treaty partly to reassure the Italians that Paris would not only face toward Berlin after Brexit.</p>, <p>But perhaps the seeds of the collapse were sown the day the treaty was signed. In Rome, Macron could not resist saying he hoped the Italians in their elections would make a pro-European choice – advice that Italians, fixated by migration from Libya, totally ignored by bringing a League and M5S coalition government to power.</p>, <p>The two parties felt Macron had tried subtly to keep them from office, and now think the remote former banker deserves to suffer for his misreading of the public’s anger with the elite. Italian anger at France’s refusal to take its share of migrants infuriates Salvini.</p>, <p>But tweaking the nose of the French president also allows the two Italian deputy prime ministers – <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/luigi-di-maio\">Luigi Di Maio</a> and Salvini – to signal to their supporters they are made from a different mould from the old political class. They ignore the normal courtesies, and in no field are there more courtesies than diplomacy.</p>, <p>Some of the dispute is about a struggle for national interest, including for influence in Africa. In Libya, the two countries vie with one another to lead European diplomacy, holding rival summits. Di Maio decries French colonialism. In Venezuela, Salvini encouraged by Russia, rejects French interference in the affairs of a Latin American country.</p>, <p>But the true context for the row is May’s European elections. Both Macron and the Salvini-Di Maio partnership are using each other as foils to define their campaigns and mobilise their core vote. Di Maio claims the yellow vests are a sign that the winds of change are sweeping across the Alps, and Macron, a bad president, will as a result be defeated, leading to broader changes in Brussels and the European parliament.</p>, <p>The danger is that the stream of insults pouring off the Italian party leaders’ Facebook pages has not just political but also economic consequences, with Italy coming off worse.

Infrastructure plans such as the Turin-Lyon high-speed rail link are in doubt.</p>, <p>Italy, in recession and heading for only 0.2% growth this year, will need some allies in <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> and in Brussels.

We need to cooperate.”</p>, <p>Merkel quoted the US Republican senator Lindsey Graham as saying: “Multilateralism may be complicated, but it’s better than simply staying at home alone.”</p>, <p>“Now that we see great pressure on the classic order we are used to, the question now is: do we fall apart into pieces of a puzzle and think everyone can solve the question best for himself alone?” Merkel said, adding that it’s better to “put yourself in the other’s shoes ... and see whether we can get win-win solutions together”.</p>, <p>She was speaking at the Munich security conference on Saturday, immediately before the US vice-president <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence\">Mike Pence</a>, who insisted: “America first never meant America alone.”</p>, <p>Pence repeatedly challenged Europe, saying it was time to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and accusing Iran of trying to commit a fresh Holocaust. He also demanded the EU step forward for freedom and recognise <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/juan-guaido\">Juan Guaidó</a> as the sole legitimate representative of Venezuela.</p>, <p>In an uncompromising speech, he also called on Germany to increase its defence spending, and abandon its plan to build a new gas pipeline from Russia – <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/11/germany-and-russia-gas-links-trump-questions-europe-nord-stream2\">Nord Stream 2</a>.</p>, <p>In Merkel’s speech, punctuated by warm applause largely absent from Pence’s address, the outgoing chancellor effectively challenged Trump’s world vision with a practical, point-by-point rebuttal of nationalist isolationism.</p>, <p>She revealed that <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/germany\">Germany</a> is shocked when it hears the US administration describe German BMWs as a threat to US national security, pointing out the largest BMW car plant was not in Bavaria, but South Carolina, supplying cars to China. “We are proud of our cars and we are allowed to be that. Frankly, if you have a problem, if you have a headache, it is better to come and talk about it,” she said.</p>, <p>The US Department of Commerce is due to decide shortly if tariffs should be imposed on German cars.</p>, <p>Merkel also challenged Trump on his unilateral decision to immediately withdraw US troops from north-west Syria, asking whether the policy will strengthen Russia and Iran’s hand to influence the situation on the ground.</p>, <p>Merkel said she was criticised every day over her support for the Iran nuclear deal, but asked whether it was helpful to the west’s common goal of containing Iran’s wider negative behaviour, including in Yemen, “to cancel the only existing agreement with Iran, or it is a small lever to maintain pressure on other issues? This is a tactical question.”</p>, <p>She urged the US not to decide alone on a possible troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. It took a lot of effort to convince the German public about the <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> Bundeswehr mission, she explained, adding a US withdrawal might force a German withdrawal due to the integration of forces.</p>, <p>The German government decided a few days ago to extend the mission by one year, a decision that will be put to the Bundestag in March. Almost 1,300 German soldiers are currently stationed in the Hindu Kush, north Afghanistan.</p>, <p>Discussing the Russian and American decision to cancel the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty (INF), she said: “Disarmament is something that concerns us all, and where we would, of course, be delighted if such talks were held not just between the United States, <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> and Russia, but also with China.”</p>, <p>She accepted the US justification for <a class=\"u-underline\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/inf-donald-trump-confirms-us-withdrawal-nuclear-treaty\">pulling out of the INF</a> this month in response to Moscow’s deployment of the 9M729 missile. The move prompted Russia to announce its own withdrawal, something that will greatly effect European security.</p>, <p>While blaming one another for the treaty breakdown, both Washington and Moscow have also voiced concern that the INF – a bilateral treaty between the US and Russia – does nothing to constrain the rapidly growing military power of China.</p>, <p>According to a new report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, up to 95% of China’s arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles would be in breach of the INF if Beijing were party to it.</p>, <p>Merkel defended levels of German defence spending, saying it was due to reach 1.5% by 2024, well below the 2% target set collectively by <a class=\"u-underline\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato\">Nato</a>, the transatlantic defence alliance. “For us, it is very much an essential big step forward.”</p>, <p>She also queried spending measured against GDP as the best reference point for judging defence spending, adding that European development spending in Africa also brought greater security, by providing jobs that reduced the impulse of African youth to migrate to Europe.</p>, <p>Merkel urged Trump to understand the importance of Nato as a symbol of something deeper than security. “We have to think in networked structures. The military component is one of them. We need Nato as a stability anchor in stormy times. We need it as a community of values.”</p>]'}\n",

And yet the phones keep ringing, hour after hour.</p>, <p>“They’re calling from Sydney, London, New York,” says the exhausted deputy mayor, Giuseppe Cacioppo. A week after the town announced it was putting up abandoned homes for sale <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/17/italian-town-sambuca-sicily-dozens-homes-for-sale-one-euro\" title=\"\">at a euro each</a>, he has fielded requests for information from all over the globe. By Wednesday last week the council had received more than 300 calls and 94,000 emails. Many prospective buyers, not wanting to miss out, grabbed the first available flight to Palermo.</p>, <p>Sambuca sits inside a nature reserve, surrounded by woods and mountains, about an hour’s drive from the Sicilian capital.</p>, <p>In the town hall’s minuscule waiting room there are not enough seats for the dozens of visitors who have come from as far away as Panama, London, Boston and Dubai to get their hands on one of these famed homes for the cost of an espresso. They’re waiting anxiously for Cacioppo to take them on a guided tour of the ruins that are up for sale.</p>, <p>It is quite a sight for 63-year-old Franco Lo Vecchio. Curious to see what the chatter is all about, he has rushed out of his house in the nearby Saraceno quarter in his slippers. He stands, mouth agape, looking at the long queue of foreigners who have come to see what’s on offer.</p>, <p>It’s been a long time since so many people have gathered in the streets of Sambuca: once a bustling town of 9,000 people, it now has about 5,000. Like many small towns in southern <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-component=\"auto-linked-tag\" data-link-name=\"auto-linked-tag\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a>, it has been gradually abandoned by citizens seeking work elsewhere.</p>, <p>“The decline began with the industrialisation of the agricultural sector, when machines replaced human labour and forced many peasants to abandon the fields,” says Lo Vecchio, who used to work as a French language teacher. “Then, if that weren’t enough, the earthquake struck and even more families began abandoning their homes.”</p>, <p>In January 1968 the earth shook in the Belice valley, in south-west Sicily. Measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale, the earthquake was <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/aug/30/where-it-was-but-not-how-it-was-how-the-sicilian-earthquake-divided-a-town-salemi\" title=\"\">one of the most powerful</a> to strike Italy, killing 231 people, injuring more than 1,000 and leaving 100,000 homeless. Four towns were razed entirely and others, like Sambuca, suffered terrible damage. The town’s main church, the Chiesa Madre, built around 1420 on part of the ancient Arab castle of Zabut in the oldest part of town, was so badly damaged it had to close.</p>, <p>The story of the Lo Vecchio family reflects the history of Sambuca and the emigratory trend that threatens its survival. In 1955, Franco’s grandfather left for the US in search of work. In 1957, his father moved to Venezuela. In 1963, Franco himself left for northern Italy, and his daughter has now settled in Australia. Franco returned to Sambuca three years ago. “I was struck by the deserted roads and by the silence where once the voices of thousands of people echoed in the squares,” he says. “Sambuca, my Sambuca, now seemed a cemetery for the living dead.”</p>, <p>In an attempt to resuscitate the town, the mayor, Leo Ciaccio, and his deputy, Cacioppo, have adopted a strategy that has become fashionable in the south: sell, or practically give away, abandoned homes to anyone who wants to move in. Other towns have attempted the same thing, including Gangi in northern Sicily, Salemi in the west near Marsala, and Ollolai in Sardinia. The symbolic price of a home: a euro. (Another approach is to facilitate the <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/11/italy-alberghi-diffusi-village-hotels\" title=\"\">turning of abandoned homes into “scattered hotels</a>”.)</p>, <p>“Some people think that’s all it takes – the cost of a cup of coffee,” says Cacioppo. “They’re wrong. It’s an auction that starts at one euro. If those who participate do not bid higher, then yes, the house will be sold for the price of a croissant.”</p>, <p>Currently there are 17 council-owned homes for sale in Sambuca. Another 15 will soon be added. Another 400 privately owned homes may yet come up for sale because they have been abandoned. The majority of the dwellings date from the mid-1800s; many of them were damaged in the earthquake and abandoned immediately after. They are homes where time stands still. In one two-storey house, which once belonged to a local carabinieri officer, a calendar on the wall is turned to July 1967.</p>, <p>Some visitors leave the homes unimpressed. Others are smiling. “There is much potential in these homes,” says Nick, a 46-year-old property developer from London who did not want his surname to be published. He was in Kiev airport, waiting to board a flight to London, when he read an article about the sale of homes for a euro in a delightful Sicilian town. “I didn’t think twice. I winked at my wife and she agreed. We left the boarding queue for London and ran to the first ticket counter to purchase a flight to Palermo.”</p>, <p>Polish couple Urszula and Maciej Kuziemska couldn’t resist either. They now live in Boston, and came to Sambuca in the hope of buying a romantic pied-à-terre away from the big city. Samar Choudhuri, another property developer, came from Panama to propose buying several homes in Sambuca for a group of investors. Caroline O’Hare, a British lawyer, arrived from Dubai, and Ammar Alansari came from the United Arab Emirates. He says he was bewitched by Sicily’s Arab architecture and culture.</p>, <p>Franco Lo Vecchio looks at them with curiosity. The people of Sambuca have largely embraced the mayor’s plan, seeing it as a courageous act – a last-ditch effort to bring Sambuca back from its terminal illness.</p>, <p>But not everyone is hopeful. Some believe there’s no way Sambuca can be saved from the decline history has reserved for small towns in southern Italy. Caterina, 50, is one. She regrets having returned to Sicily from Switzerland three years ago, leaving a job where she earned about £2,700 a month. Standing in front of her cafe on the deserted Corso Umberto, she lights a cigarette and contemplates the streets of Sambuca. “I still don’t know why I came back to work in a deserted bar where I’m forced to close two hours early because the place is totally empty. Will houses on sale for a euro help this town? I wouldn’t be so sure …”</p>, <p>While potential buyers seek shelter from the rain, the restoration of the Chiesa Madre continues. For the first time since the earthquake <a class=\"u-underline in-body-link--immersive\" data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"http://agrigento.gds.it/2019/01/24/sambuca-riapre-dopo-mezzo-secolo-la-chiesa-madre_989535/\" title=\"\">the church reopened last week</a>, just in time for the new visitors to admire it. It is a fitting metaphor for Sambuca: a town that after 50 years refuses to disappear and will do anything it takes to survive, even if it means selling its homes for the price of a coffee.</p>]'}\n",
